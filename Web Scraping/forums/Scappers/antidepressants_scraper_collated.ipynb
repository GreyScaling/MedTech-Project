    "# Scraper for the following website:\n",
    "##### https://www.survivingantidepressants.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "The scraper requires a root directory which has all the links containing discussion threads for a particular area. An example is https://www.survivingantidepressants.org/forum/8-symptoms-and-self-care/ \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the scraper is created to record every single URL and iterate through it. The scraper scrapes the content and the date of each comment in discussion threads and adds them to a list. Eventually, this is transformed to a dataframe and added to the main dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Languages and frameworks used:\n",
    "* Python\n",
    "* Selenium using Python for scraping and web automation\n",
    "* Pandas for collating data\n",
    "\n",
    "### The scraper has the following functions:\n",
    "* generate_url(driver) -> list: This function takes in a root URL and scrapes every single URL in it from the first page to the last page. These URLs are used by the scrape_a_site() function to scrape. It returns a list containing URLs as strings.\n",
    "    * Parameters:\n",
    "        * driver: Selenium WebDriver element\n",
    "* scrape_a_page(all_dates_list, all_comments_list, driver) -> pandas DataFrame Object: This function scrapes a page. \n",
    "    * Parameters:\n",
    "        * all_dates_list: A list containing dates for any past pages in a particular discussion. \n",
    "        * all_comments_list: A list containing the comments for any past pages for a particular discussion\n",
    "        * driver: Selenium WebDriver element\n",
    "* scrape_a_site(url, driver): The function uses the scrape_a_page method to scrape a whole discussion thread. Since a site is made up of various pages, the previous method plays a big part. At the end, it collates all comments, and dates scraped to create a dataframe which gets returned. This dataframe contains all records of a particular discussion post/thread.\n",
    "    * Parameters:\n",
    "        * url: A string which gets passed to load the Selenium WebDriver\n",
    "        * driver: Selenium WebDriver element"
