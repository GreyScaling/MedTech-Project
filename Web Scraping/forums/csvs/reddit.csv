"When I was in grad school I volunteered to be in an experiment at the dental school. I needed to get a wisdom tooth out and the deal was that they would test out a new filling material and at the end they get to keep the tooth, and I would get $300 and free dental work.

After the first week it started to hurt. After the second week the dentists were saying to take more than a double dose of ibuprofen, and keep taking more unless my ears started ringing. By the time three weeks were up there were moments where had to sit down from the pain.

Six months after they removed the tooth I was back for a check up. I asked the dentist if the experiment was a failure and she sort of smiled and said that it was going into wider clinical trials.

That's when I realized that I had been part of the control group, valiantly proving that cavities hurt.",other
"One of my friends went in for a research  study. He got paid $4500 to try out a new med for an issue he was having (I think it was an insomnia treatment, I'll have to ask him). Anyways, now he sweats 100% of the time and has to drink over a gallon of water a day to remain reasonably hydrated.

Not worth imo.",other
"Not quite a clinical trial, but in the mid 80s my father was one of the first people to accept a new hayfever vaccine - he'd suffered badly year on year. Few weeks later, he started losing weight, feeling fatigued and just generally being ill; he was admitted to hospital and, after what he describes as hundreds of medical tests failed to find any reason for why he was ill, the best they could come up with is that somehow a heterosexual man who had never used drugs or had a blood transfusion had somehow developed AIDS (remember, this is back when it was still being called GRID.) It was just assumed he'd get sicker and sicker until he died, but one day he started to get better, which also stumped the people researching AIDS because that hadn't happened to anyone else, the eventual conclusion being they didn't know what it was but it can't have been that. Doctors basically told him he seemed fine now, just get on with his life.

He went back to get the vaccine again the next year, but was told that it had been withdrawn after loads of people died after having it. Turns out it was just a massive dose of steroids, it trashed the immune system and people couldn't fight off common illnesses. Hard to prove in retrospect, but it's assumed he came close to joining them.",other

"My boobs swelled up until it looked like I'd bolted basketballs onto my ribcage. Then, I started lactating. Like, a lot. Like, can't leave my house, cause my tits are geysers, constantly shooting out some mystery fluid and occasionally blood. Then came the vertigo and CONSTANT TINNITUS. 

After a few days of this, I advised the doctor the final side effect was going to be suicide if we didn't start weaning me off this shit.",other
"My parents own a research center. We have had a patient die before. 

The medication was in Phase 3, Phase 1 being the most dangerous and patients stay at the research center, all the way to phase 4 which is supposed to be the most safe.

Every-time a patient dies while they are in a research study the pharmaceutical company must send out a “safety letter” which is kept on site with all the names of the patients who died and their believed cause of death. We do not know the EXACT cause of death since we were not able to obtain any information after but it is safe to assume that it was the medication as it had 4 patients total die. (Not in our site but around the world 4 total.) ",other
"I was put on a clinical trial for my cancer. The sides effects where the normal  chemo ones plus risks of blood clots.

I had one in my brain which resulted in a stroke at age 26. Paralysed for 4 months.  Worst experience by far in my life

"Breast cancer treatment.  I had four rounds of the typical, hair falls out, makes you puke IV chemo, then four rounds of Taxotere, a somewhat less debilitating chemo plus the clinical trial drug, Xeloda.  The trial drug was approved for metastatic disease, which I didn't have.  

The Taxotere makes everything taste like soap.  I couldn't stand to be in the same room with food.  The Xeloda gives you killer diarrhea.  

I spent 12 weeks basically eating nothing.  I called it the Procter and Gamble Diet. I managed to choke down a chocolate milkshake once a day, and had explosive diarrhea for hours after.  I lost 50 lbs.

Turns out the Xeloda had no effect on the cancer, but the Taxotere worked fine.  I'm 12 years out from treatment.",other
"This is my line of work, clinical trial data, and one thing to keep in mind is that an adverse event is anything that happens during the trial, whether it's related or not. Dude gets headaches sometimes? Great, every headache during his time in the trial is recorded as an AE and evaluated. And you might think ""hey, I don't usually have heartburn or whatever but I just did now and it's probably the drug!"" but the doctor decides that and if there is any question there are other docs and a safety panel who will review it.

"I was on male hormonal birth control for years through clinicaltrials.gov. It was a huge success with minimal side effects and I wish I could get back on it. The drug worked and was safe but ultimately it hasn't been brought to market because most men can't stand to inject themselves with an inch-long needle every week.

Side effects were increased energy, fat loss, and increased libido.

"Not a failed trial, but I signed up for a medical study where they had to remove a lymph node from my body. They were paying $300 so I figured what's the worst that could happen, right? Well they didn't tell me that the lymph node was going to be taken from my bikini line by a 50 year old surgeon who had to rub iodine all over my hoo-ha. He sewed it up a little funny so I still have a huge scar and the wound was right where my leg bends so I walked funny for like three weeks. If anybody asked why I was limping I had to tell them about my poor disfigured vagina and it was terrible. 3/10 still got $300",other
"I took part in a clinical trial for Nasa where they paid me to essentially sleep for a month in one room. I couldn't go outside, couldn't leave the room, could play on my phone and go on the computer but that was about it. I ended up sleeping probably 16-18 hours a day out of boredom. The trial wasn't technically a failure, but afterwards I had trouble sleeping usual amounts of time as well as doing day to day tasks.",other
"My mother in law participated in a large scale trial of aspirin being tested as a cure-all for the elderly. The pharmaceutical company was trying to prove that everyone should take aspirin daily beyond a certain age to reduce blood clotting. Coincidentally it's also a great way to sell a lot of aspirin. 

My in-laws were both part of the trial and my mother in law had some medical issues that ended up involving internal bleeding. If she hadn't been on aspirin she would have been ok, but due to the blood thinning aspect of the aspirin the problem escalated badly and she ended up vomiting blood all over her hospital room and nearly died. It's hard to describe the feelings of horror and helplessness watching her vomiting blood on the floor while nurses rush into the room from everywhere, telling you to stand back and take emergency action to try to stop her dying. One of the nurses later told us that we were extremely lucky that she lived. 

A few weeks after her near death experience a group of people from the pharmaceutical company showed up unannounced at their house and ever-so-gently pressured them into signing a waiver withdrawing from the trial and saying they wouldn't sue. Being nice trusting elderly people they signed it. We later found out that the whole large scale trial had been canned that same day. 

Since they got her agreement to withdraw it won't be recorded in any official report that the trial nearly killed her - just that she withdrew from it. The whole thing really stank in my opinion. I imagine that they want to keep their options open to run more trials in future so they didn't want her negative result hanging over them.",other
"I did a clinical trial attempting to treat Crohn's with an antibiotic. It turned my poop, pee, and even my jizz bright yellow.

"I got pregnant.

Trial for a non-hormonal birth control gel. First month, used it probably three or four times (long distance bf, we only see each other on weekends, if that), bam. I'm eleven weeks in.

It's ok. It's unplanned, I thought about terminating, but we both wanted kids, and we want to be together, so we decided to figure it out. We're both in graduate school, both graduating before the due date, so hopefully we'll be more financially secure when it gets here.

 The worst part is probably having to explain. I usually just say it was unplanned and people don't ask, but with my parents and close friends, I had to explain. I ended up just saying we were switching methods and things got messed up, which is the truth.",other
"I once attended a trial for some kind of antidepressant or anxiolytic. First they injected me something (edit: cholecystokinin) to cause an anxiety attack and I had to evaluate the severity. It was supposed to be the maximum (10/10) but it wasn’t for me (6/10). I realized that I have had anxiety attacks before. I was evaluated as a healthy person, but it turned out I was not and in denial about my mental health. I didn’t follow to the next step.",other
"Did a study for something that was supposed to be comparable to nuva ring. I was told that they had no real reason to think it wouldn't prevent pregnancy, it was more of a study to see how it eased period symptoms (they did suggest I use condoms just incase). I wasn't worried about it, I'm not very fertile anyway and getting paid to use free birth control sounded cool. I had the worst, heaviest, painfull periods I had seen since before I started taking other birth control. But it was really only bad for two days a month so I could live with it. It was supposed to be a 12 month study but They canceled it after about 7months. 5 girls out of maybe 50 or so had gotten pregnant. The lady at the center said they had all been very obese and they figured that had something to do with the why it was ineffective, and that I, a thin person shouldn't be worried. I didn't get pregnant but the fact that my period symtoms were so awful makes me think it probably wasn't working for me and the fact that I didn't get pregnant was just random.
Honestly though I would do it all over again of I had the chance and just use condoms, I got two free pap smears and a total of about $400",other
"I consider it a fail, however the medicine they used has gone on to the next phase in being approved by the FDA.

I was part of a trial where they were testing an extended pain relief injection (a mixture of marcaine and bupivicaine)for recovery after surgery, to try and limit the amount of narcotics needed for pain relief. I received a bunionectomy, and stayed in the clinic for 3 days while they monitored me by taking blood at regular intervals as well as vitals. I had the option for rescue meds if I needed them. The nurses in the clinic destroyed my hands and arms from not being able to properly withdraw blood, and were not the nicest people. After being discharged I developed a very large blister on the top of the foot that was operated on, and I rapidly declined from there. I ended up having a hole on top of my foot the size of a half dollar, which exposed the metatarsal and joint of my big toe, which in turn exposed me to a host of different types of infection. I lost my job because of being extremely sick, I had to have over 8 surgeries (three of which I woke up during), had a wound vacuum for around 8 months, had to be in a hyperbaric chamber 3-4 times a week, antibiotic resistant infections including a chronic bone infection, and also became dependent on painkillers. I couldn't walk for over a year, and was almost hospitalized a few times. At one point we were discussing possible amputation. I was severely depressed. I was one of three people who had this happen to them. 

I have permanent scars and deformations from what I went through. I'll never be the same again because of this. And none of what I experienced was listed in the informed consent that I signed. ",other
"I was in a trial where they were testing a new instrument to intubate people with. Somehow it got stuck in my throat and I was choking bad as the anesthesia kicked in and I lost consciousness.  It’s a very strange feeling to be choking as you lose consciousness into the darkness. I thought I may be dying. It was traumatic and my throat was very sore for a week after that. 

I know it was a trial and I signed up for it, but the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth. Seemed like amateur hour. ",other
"Not as severe as other people here, but I was in a study testing the benefits to asthma sufferer's overall breathing from taking Alegra. It works ok on allergy symptoms but didn't do squat for my lung capacity or frequency of asthma attacks.

Was in an adult ADD trial to make concerta being on adults with ADD. Every week dosage increased. Eventually dose went over 100mg a day.  I didn't sleep for what seemed like weeks and lost loads of weight.  I really think they wanted to see how high they could take it.  After a few weeks of that I refused to be in study if they raised it anymore. ,other

Not directly related but I wanted to say a big thanks for everyone who give time to these.

"I'm in a clinical trial now. After the first infusion, I woke up about 3AM with God-awful inching on the back of my legs. Itching is one of the main side effects of the drug being tested. Later that day my feet swelled up to where I couldn't wear shoes, could barely walk using two canes, and turned red. Oh, I also had a full body rash and my left knee swelled to the size of a grapefruit. This was all over a weekend where my oncologist was out of town so I couldn't get any help and I really tried! It was very unpleasant for about 4 -5 days. I haven't had a recurrence of symptoms with two subsequent infusions. Keeping my fingers crossed!",other
"I took part in a few for my sleep trouble.  I couldn't stay awake on one.  At all. I fell asleep in class,  on the bus, at lunch,  standing up,  walking,  eating, etc. It was truly awful. I had AWFUL night terrors. Way worse than they ever had been before.   Turns out they gave me some crazy high dose of a powerful schizophrenia drug called ""geodon"" something like 3x what they'd give a fully schizophrenic 250 man. I was a 15 Year old girl,  115 lbs. .

"I took part in a trial for renal denervation; they destroy the nerves running from the kidneys in order to reduce blood pressure.  This involved an angiogram which is a wire threaded through the artery in my groin up to my kidneys where ultrasound is used to ablate the nerves running alongside the artery. 

A previous trial was halted in the past because both the placebo group and the group having the procedure showed a drop in blood pressure.  Apparently there are so many factors involved in BP regulation that even a sham operation can have an effect. 

So this new trial was double blind.  Only the surgeon would know if the machine would actually be switched on and all 300 participants were to have an angiogram. 

My operation failed.  It was abandoned when they discovered that my artery branches and is wider than 4m.  This means any nerves are outside the ablation zone. 

But they didn't discover this until I was laying naked in an operating theatre, with my crotch shaved, under sedation, with a wire threaded into my groin. 

When they pull out the wire, the hole is sealed with a collagen plug.  This involves the surgeon pulling the wire until blood spurts out of my artery, then pushing down into the crease of my groin with all of his weight to activate the plug and seal the wound.  Despite being under sedation I was flailing and yelling because it was so painful.  They put me further under and I woke up in a pool of blood.  

This is all normal.  Look up angioplasty on YouTube if you want to watch how it's done. 

I am extremely disappointed that they couldn't destroy the nerves as I really, really want to be free of blood pressure medication.  I am now on a trial researching how the nitrites in beetroot reduces blood pressure. ",other

"I uh. I was the reason it failed. It was a VERY well put together psychology experiment in decision making. Took hours just to be a part of. It was seeing if men or women would be higher risk takers. 
The people programmed video games, made long questionnaires, put together tons of work. 
We started as a group of 50 men and women then split to 25 of each separately. Then 5 groups of 5. 
About ten minutes Into being in the 25 person group I asked 
“Wait. Are we just supposed to avoid risks in this to get the better score?”
We had been told it was decision making not risk taking. Risk was the variable. When I called it out we all tailored our choices differently. 

I was later banned from trials. My professor was kind of annoyed at me for that. ",other
"I have only been in one clinical trial which I was told was ended early. It was an open label trial for an extended release version of Lexapro. I was in the trial for about a year and a half. I was doing great on it and was super happy.  But I also gained 40 pounds. On my second to last visit the doctor asked me what I was doing about the weight gain. I said ""buying bigger clothes?"" At my next visit they told me the trial was ending early because they were not finding it to be any more effective than normal Lexapro. I have doubts as to whether they were telling me the truth.  

I also voluntarily ended a trial early once. This one was for a second generation antipsychotic. I had severe tremors, felt out of it all the time, and had the worst constipation ever. But the straw that broke the camel's back was when I started having severe muscle pains in random places. Like it felt as though I had worked out my glutes or my hams really hard, but I hadn't.  And the area would change every few days. They told me it was likely a side effect of the drug. I stopped taking it a few days later. ",other
"My husband used to work for a company that ran clinical trials for new psych drugs. Most of these new psych drugs are just versions of older drugs, seeing if a drug developed for one illness could help another, etc. There was one guy testing a new atypical antipsychotic who passed out and went to the hospital and was having some kind of heart issue. 

Most of the time though, the side effects are the same as they would be when the drug is approved (weight gain, GI distress, drowsiness), and failure isn't about what the drug does but rather what it doesn't do. For-profit drug testing companies seek volunteers who are willing to take trial meds in exchange for very low pay and some medical and psychiatric care, so a lot of the test subjects were mentally ill homeless people who saw trial treatment as better than no treatment. The worst thing that happened to most of these test subjects is that they were on meds that didn't work. It's a system that preys on desperate people who can't afford healthcare. ",other

"I'm severely allergic to peanuts and did an ""allergy challenge"" when I was a kid. What happens is that they'll give you tiny little bits of peanut protein in your food and hope that you won't react because of how small it is, then they can gradually increase the amount of protein over time and hopefully cure your allergy by acclimating your body to the peanut. 

I could feel the hard little bits of peanut in my silky-smooth kraft dinner, so because I was a total little shit, I collected the bits in my mouth and spat them out in the bathroom after the trial. The doctors got really happy and it looked so promising! Then my mom essentially scared me into swallowing my whole bites, which foiled my plan and sent me straight into anaphylaxis. 

I tried to apply for a similar trial when I was 18 but now they have blood work that tests your levels of anti-peanut antibodies, so I had to get this test done to see if I was eligible to enroll. Turns out that I'm literally too allergic to be in these trials! ",other

"Was in a clinical trial for a PTSD medication. Double blind but I figured out pretty quickly I was in the control group. I then un-blinded myself to my main researcher at the end, telling him I knew I hadn't been receiving the test medication and why I knew it. Listed my evidence. Just to be an asshole. Never joined a clinical trial again. Fuck clinical trials. 

Edit: Wow the downvote love, I'm feelin it! 

As clarification, this wasn't a trial for multiple sclerosis or cancer, as has been mentioned. And anyone who has been through a clinical trial knows that you're pretty much cattle. You're there to prove or disprove the hypothesis, not as an individual under the care of another individual. For that reason, and because I personally don't find PTSD an effective target of a clinical trial, I will not be returning to clinical trials. 

They certainly exist for a good purpose for severe medical conditions and diseases. And if I had some agressive, awful disease I probably wouldn't care about the impersonal aspects.

Then if it happens during the trial, you pull out the history, remind the subject what they said before, and then ask, ""is this different than usual?"" If no different, include that in the note (in which case it's not captured as an AE, because it's the subject's history), and if it is different, record it as an AE unless it is milder than usual, in which few cases I've had this, I inform the medical monitor and ask them how they want me to capture it.

You are afflicted with a condition and you want to know that you are being treated with something that will give you a chance to live a close to normal life.

They are necessary for marketing approval by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. There are of course conditions (infection, epilepsy) where it is unethical to randomize patients to receive a placebo (you would never give a patient with an infection a placebo). In those cases, you have an active comparator, where patients receive the standard of care instead of placebo, and your experimental treatment is compared against that.

His first symptom was a crazy bad headache. I have known him for 20+ years and he never gets headaches, so this was a big warning sign. He went to the doctor after 3 days and told them he thought it was malaria and they basically didn't take him seriously. This was also at the time when the Ebola virus was blowing up in Africa. 

The big problem came after about 8-9 days and I watched him drink liters of water and still be thirsty and not needing to pee. Then he collapsed at home. Took him to urgent care thinking maybe they can give him IV fluids - they couldn't even register his blood pressure it was so low. The UC doctor called 911 and the firefighters who responded first couldn't even get a blood prick for a blood sugar test.

He was rushed to the ER where they confirmed within the hour that he had malaria. He finally was able to pee about 6 hours later and it was essentially the color of very, very dark tea - almost black. He was then transferred to ICU.

The next day he was yellow! Yellow eyes, yellow skin, yellow hands. He was septic.

Actually that’s not the case.  There are placebo controlled trials which compare a new drug or treatment to a placebo.  In this case the placebo is null treatment.  Many of these types of trials have procedures in place to provide placebo patients with standard treatment after the trial is over.  Then you have comparator trials where a new drug or treatment is directly compared to an existing drug.  Neither is inherently unethical although both can be problematic for different reasons.  That’s why a drug has to go through several stages and different types of studies before it is approved for use.  Also the IRB would have to approve a placebo controlled trial before a patient is ever enrolled.  That same IRB has the re-review the study every year to continue enrolling patients.,other

My reaction was that 1 in a million that has to be mentioned, but is so rare, it never happens outside of clinical trials.

The reason I like what my parents do is because we get to help people with medical conditions but honestly most of the time the people we help is because they need the money so the join research studies.

In order to start a business like this you either need the knowledge or the funds. If you have the knowledge you can find someone to fund your project. My dad was the one with the funds and learned a long the way. Learning came at a cost and I’m talking hundreds of thousands of dollars.

This was when my surgeon said I would be able to play football if I wanted. I complained. He told me that sometimes it takes longer, and to check back in three more months. 

I cover my chest with books or my arms everywhere I go. 

Three more months go by and I feel like I can poke my chest without excruciating pain, but as I increase the force with which I poke myself, it’s clear from the pain that any direct hit would be horrible. And I can still only sleep on my back. I tell him, he says it looks great, but sometimes it takes longer to heal. Check back six months for a one-year checkup. 

In the mean time, I get ultrasounds and different scans and x-rays done. They all look fine. 

One year check-up, I can take a decent hit, but I can’t sleep on my side. If I roll over in my sleep and stay on my side for more than a couple minutes I wake up in awful pain. This pain feels like one half of my ribs is about to slip under the other.  It’s horrible and has never stopped in all this time. I tell him this and he says that in very rare cases it can take longer, and that it’s getting better so just wait and it will slowly get better over the next year. And “it healed beautifully,” “looks wonderful,” etc.

Two year mark I see no improvement at all. This is when I cry and tell him it was a failure. I interrupted him when he was calling it beautiful. I felt like nobody believed me even though it was making my back hurt constantly, leaving a dent in my bed from sleeping in the same spot every night. Making me an insomniac.

Yes, HIV is entirely treatable now. While you still lose a few years of life expectancy, you generally have the same as the general population.  Drug resistance is happening though, and we’re finding more resistant strains all the time. So, it might not be treatable forever. 

As an example, my old lab worked on CRF19, which is the most aggressive strain ever found. Progression from HIV to AIDS when untreated usually takes 10 years, with this strain it takes 3.

""Two types (species) of parasites, Plasmodium vivax and P. ovale, have liver stages and can remain in the body for years without causing sickness. If not treated, these liver stages may reactivate and cause malaria attacks (“relapses”) after months or years without symptoms. People diagnosed with P. vivax or P. ovale are often given a second drug to help prevent these relapses. Another type of malaria, P. malariae, if not treated, has been known to stay in the blood of some people for several decades.

"Agreed. Pain perception is a very subjective thing, one person experiences the same stimulus as much more/less painful than their matched peer. This can make it hard for a trial employee to accurately gauge whether someone is truly in pain and needs to be dropped. Further, without a review of the encouraging language used, it is very difficult to say that the IRB's ethical guidelines. In fairness, telling someone to keep taking more ibuprofen until they hit a dose that makes their ears ring (if that's how this was actually meant), is at least dumb. I'm not sure how someone in a trial would know that there had been drop out, but I know with certainty that pilot data is used to calculate necessary sample sizes. The calculated sample sizes are typically determined and presented as ""the sample size was chosen to be 90% powered with 30% dropout rate"" kinda thing. Drop out isn't something you avoid, you attempt to predict it and preempt it. If the trial continued to later stages, it is likely the researchers achieved statistical power, making claims about drop out rates being high unlikely, IMO. ",other

"I work in this space and what’s so amazing is that once they have the manufacturing down and all you need to do is change the sequence to make different drugs, it will completely change the industry. A huge challenge is making this stuff. Developing the process and making the stuff reliably is often the biggest challenges for any biotech. Your scientists may come up with the most promising molecule but if you can’t make it at scale it’s useless. mRNA uses the body to manufacture the antigen, or a protein, which provides the therapeutic benefit, cutting out biopharmaceutical mfr altogether. It huge huge achievement.",cancer
">While this is the spike protein on the virus's surface for the coronavirus, it could be a protein on the surface of a tumor cell in the case of cancer. Once the immune system recognizes the protein, antibodies or T cells can be produced to fight and destroy it, as well as the cells that contain it.  

There's another way an mRNA vaccine could be used against a tumor. How so?

You inject an mRNA treatment into the tumor itself. The tumor cells are then instructed by the mRNA to produce some kind of antigen. This will elicit a Cellular Mediated Immune Response. 

Cell Mediated Immunity is a part of your immune system involving T cells and the ability to detect and kill infected cells.

So when the tumor cells begin expressing an antigen, they will look like they're infected by a virus. CMI will kick in and your own immune system will start killing off the tumor cells that have been treated by the mRNA.

It's also possible that, with repeat treatments, the repeatedly stimulated CMI can be trained to recognize and attack the rest of the tumor as well.

* The plus here is the superior specificity of an immune response vs surgery or chemo.

* It's also a lot quicker and easier to do a series of injections into a tumor.

* This method might be capable of treating tumors that would otherwise be considered inoperable.

* The down side would be that this technique might be limited to solid tumors.

* You would also need to be careful to restrict the application of the therapeutic mRNA to the tumor only... so as not to elicit a CMI response against the surrounding, healthy tissues.",cancer

">Interestingly, what some people might not realize is that your immune system is *constantly* finding cancerous cells and killing them before they multiply into a big problem.

Whenever you have a sunburn, you should realize that it's your body killing of skin cells which have been damaged by UV radiation. The damage itself isn't necessarily painful but could lead to cancer. The body's reaction can be painful but it prevents cancer.

Next time you have a sunburn, try to appreciate the pain a bit, since it's your body protecting you from cancer.",cancer

So since you seem to be fairly knowledgeable what do you think of the data they presented in solid tumors. An ORR of 8 % is at least to me not particularly impressive at all. https://www.aacr.org/about-the-aacr/newsroom/news-releases/personalized-cancer-vaccine-plus-atezolizumab-shows-clinical-activity-in-patients-with-advanced-solid-tumors/,cancer
"So is this an effective ""cure""? Or what is this vaccine really going to do",cancer
"Sadly, false positive results are not the biggest issue with cancer blood tests. The problem is that there are literally thousands, millions or perhaps infinite mutations causing cancer. In advanced cancer, each “tumor” is comprised of several unique populations of cancer cells, with unique mutations, combinations of mutations, interactions between cancer “driver” mutations with an individuals’ somatic and germline variations, etc. Even for genes with a high frequency of mutations in tumors (eg p53), there are many different specific ways it can be mutated with different effects.
The Covid vaccine development was so fucking beautifully done and epic, we want to think other diseases will be solved soon too, but cancer is such a different beast. It’s possible that some simple cancer types could be (very expensively) addressed with this, but that’s useless for most people. Trying to defeat cancer is like trying to be the best olympic athlete; you might succeed for a bit but you will inevitably lose. It’s like trying to stop Japan from inventing and developing new and better technologies. Cancer is just such a powerful unstoppable FORCE OF NATURE.",cancer

Pfizer came in after the development was done, because BioNTech then was a very small company (50 to 100 people) with not rnough capital (which could have helped by the German state) und no knowledge how to approve a vaccine world-wide (not exactly a job for the German state). So they could have made a partnership with e.g. the swiss Hoffman-La Roche. Or the french Sanofi. Or, or, or.

"Your organism's immune system already fights cancerous cells, but it doesn't means it can react fast or strongly enough to actually stop all/any single one of them in time.  
  
A vaccine might probably help strengthening the response enough to make a difference early on hopefully :)",cancer
"Yeah, it's quite interesting really they can target mutations or antigens that are normally not found on your normal cells but specifically on cancer cells but the catch is that it is harder to detect them. But once you get pass that detection phase which is one of the limiting factor, you can theoretically develop a vaccine against that tumor antigen.

This is something our body can usually fight against abnormal cell growth but one of the reason cancer develops is when our immune system fails us. Cancer vaccine would help to boost our immune system to be able to better recognise those cancer cells.

That's why I'm so interested in this area and am studying cancer vaccine for my PhD",cancer
The nightmare thing is that we all are getting cancerous cells all the time and our immune system constantly fights them. The illness starts when it for some reason fails to do so.,cancer
"It's because the way it works is that it attacks a specific protein, rather than a cell, or a virus, or whatever. The trick is finding the right protein to attack, and then feed the mRNA sequence which codes for that protein in as the vaccine. Your body will then manufacture small amounts of that protein by itself that your immune system will then make antibodies for. Then, once your body sees those same proteins on the surface of your cancer cells, it goes all nutso apeshit on those cells before they have a chance to grow out of control and do their whole killing you thing.",cancer
"Your body kills a few dozen (hundred?) cancerous cells a day. Your immune system is actually phenomenal at doing so. That's why developing a tumor is such a big issue - this is cancer being so evasive the immune system doesn't realize it's there.

This vaccine basically trains the immune system to ""see"" these cancerous cells as invaders instead of body cells. This is a huge deal, as it means that we can vaccinate against cancers you have a family history of, as well as against cancers that you have had removed so they can't return or metastasize.

---

mRNA is also a big step forward on this. They were working on a genetic modification tech for decades on this ([relevant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/938/)), but always ran into the problem of how to modify immune cells to attack cancer without them misbehaving in other ways. The mRNA sidesteps this issue by not modifying the T-cells at all. We hack regular body cells to pretend to be the cancer cells (spit out cancer cell markings without adding the ""reproduces uncontrollably"" issue) in a really obvious way and let the T-cells do their thing. Later on when they see actual cancer cells being subtle, they already know what to look for (chemically speaking) and aren't fooled.",cancer

"Interestingly enough, cancer cells utilise similar mechanisms to viruses to evade detection by immune cells such as downregulation of certain receptor expression.",cancer
"Your immune system fights cancer all the time. You probably already had some problematic cells that it took care of. Cancerous cells usually also have mutations that make them really good at evading your immune system. That's when the problems start. There's already immunomodulating therapies for certain cancers out there, the concept isn't entirely new.",cancer
The technology relies on the genetic differences between normal cells and cancer cells (the mutations) to train the immune system to selectively target the cancer cells.,cancer
The immune system kills off rogue cells all the time.  Cancer cells develop to trick your immune system to be blind to them. So training the immune system is a natural progression from what our bodies already know how to do!,cancer

"Cancer is other word for mutated cells. Some people can be born with them same way you can develop it in life - you wait long enough you are bound to develop cancerous cells in your body. 90% of the time (the real number is probably much higher) your immune system deals with it long before the cells spreading.

"Because preventing cancer isn't as profitable as having to spend an obscene amount of money to treat it. If it fails, well there are plenty of other people out there to make money off of.",cancer
"Firstly I would say it’s one thing to make a vaccine for a virus, another thing entirely to make it target a person’s own mutated cells. 

Cancer isn’t a virus, so a vaccine approach isn’t exactly an intuitive process - From what I understand, there is a crossover between how the immune system responds to Covid-19 and how it confuses the immune system to attack your own cells and Cancer research in why your immune system can struggle to differentiate cancer cells from healthy ones.

Simply put Covid-19 has forced us to better understand the immune system. 
Also, your estimate of deaths/year is somewhat erroneous, because we have had lockdowns and restrictions to stall the transmission of Covid. Take that out of the picture, coupled with the effect of overcapacity health systems, we could easily have had numbers in the hundreds of millions within a year.",cancer

"The problem is that education has become soft. The masses have no respect for science because it is difficult and poorly understood by many.  Humans have always been deeply suspicious of things they do not understand. 

Our domestic educational institutions have not done a good job of teaching science (let alone math and other “hard” subjects), outside of the few prestigious or private institutions that focus on it (and which few can afford). As well, profit-driven schools are incentivized to provide “higher education” to their client students in a way that does not cause drop-outs and thus loss of tuition revenue - so there’s lots of educational streams within higher education that do not require even a basic understanding of math or science.

To many people, even to those who have obtained higher level educational degrees, science is mysterious at best and pure witchcraft, at worst.

The answer I think is not to continually bash the scientifically inept population; they are a lost generation. The answer is to invest in education and become a home-grown scientific powerhouse nation again. Increase educational standards and push students in all segments toward these subjects.

"mRNA vaccin are the culmination of 50 years of research. One of the main challenge was to find the technic to keep the mRNA stable long enough to be delivered through a vaccin.

https://www.biospace.com/article/the-mrna-revolution-is-here-and-it-took-about-50-years/

I would expect similar challenge for CRISPR, but a shorter time frame due to the exponential nature of technological development.",cancer
It’s not newly found it’s just newly heavily funded.,cancer
"Works just like the mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2: pieces of RNA are injected, cells absorb, transcribe and produce proteins based on that RNA. Said proteins are antigens only found in the cancer cells. Organism develops antibodies to fight said proteins.

In this case, likely not the same type of ABs that inactivate, but tagging ABs, that make the cancerous cells visible and targets for the immune system cells.",cancer
"They stared developing mRNA technology about 20 years ago when the OG SARS and MERS happened. It just so happened that the tech was largely ready to go and just awaiting the specific instructions for the specific protein to be targeted when SARS-CoV-2 was sequenced. That's the short answer. The plane was built, but they needed the pilot. That's why they were able to create this specific vaccine so quickly when it started. It's extraordinarily promising for future vaccines, as well.

It's a goddamn miracle, is what it is, and I'm an atheist.

CRISPR is far newer, but also promises to be a very powerful tool in the toolkit.",cancer
"mRNA uses your body's ribosomes to produce proteins that (in this case) your body learns to see as a threat and develops immune response to it. As a vaccine it's not much different than a traditional vaccine except they enlist your body to make the virus parts that are the vaccine, instead of just injecting you directly with virus parts or a weakened strain of the virus. Super cool.

CRISPR actually modifies your body's DNA, causing your cells to change their behavior until those cells that have been modified die (unless the change is done very early in human development, like if it were applied to an embryo, but I digress).

They are definitely related, but CRISPR is more complex in the effect it could have in therapy and we are way earlier in the process of learning about it.",cancer
"It's a form of immunotherapy, and the mRNA is the delivery mechanism.

I'd say it's similarly important to CRISPR, in that it's a general-purpose delivery mechanism for producing proteins in the body. The main use we've come up with is vaccines, but there's probably other things we could do with it too. The first wide scale tests of it happened this year because of COVID, but it's been in development for decades. CRISPR is also likely seeing use in making new mRNA payloads as quickly as we have.",cancer
"Not in medicine so take what I say with a grain of salt, but iirc alot of the funding for mRNA research was because of COVID",cancer
"It’s a form of gene theory like CRISPR though I believe CRISPR uses viruses to alter genes in cells which is less effective as some people develop or have immunity to said viruses.   
mRNA vaccines introduce a blueprint for cells to produce a viral protein which the body then creates an immune response to counter. (In Covid a case that’s the spike protein which the body then fights so when Covid is encountered the body can already fight the spike protein). Though I don’t fully understand the process on how it makes cells do this.    

It’s been in development for decades but has only just been used on people.    


It’s pretty cool though and seems more direct and controllable then CRISPR. How it fights cancer though is beyond me. And I’m not a biologist this is just what iv read from studies / papers so I could be 100% wrong.",cancer
">I still can't help but be a bit skeptical if I'll have long-term negative effects

When people say ""long term negative effects"", what they *mean* is ""effects that don't happen in the short term, but crop up out of nowhere years later.""

Vaccines don't have those. The components of a vaccine are metabolized and broken down within weeks. There's nothing left in your body to cause new symptoms years later.  Any effects that extend into the long term can only be long-lasting short-term effects, and have thus will have already been seen and accounted for in the data.",cancer
"So that's actually a really interesting topic, and the answer is surprisingly basic: cancer is pretty rare and slow. COVID is very widespread and fast.

The way you run a clinical trial is to give the medicine to relevant people, then wait until you have a high enough quantity of results to make a statistically significant decision on whether the medicine works, and whether it causes any dangerous side effects. To do that, you need either lots of people or very obvious effects (or ideally, as happened with the COVID vaccines, both).

For COVID that was easy: everyone is vulnerable, and it's everywhere. They were able to recruit a hundred thousand volunteers almost overnight if they wanted. They split the group in half, gave half of them the vaccine, and waited to see how many caught COVID. Since it was 90%+ effective, the difference was very obvious very quickly.

For cancer it's much slower to actually find your patients. You can't give experimental drugs to people unless the existing ones won't work for them, so you need people who:

- Have the right kind of cancer
- Don't respond to the best existing medicines
- But are still healthy enough to have a chance
- Are able and willing to go to your treatment sites
- And are willing to take your experimental drug
- And who you actually are able to find.
- And aren't already in another study.

As you can imagine, there's a pretty short list of people every year who meet all those criteria. Then the treatment itself can take months per patient.

In short: most studies aren't long because they want to find long term effects. They're long because sometimes science is slow for reasons beyond our control.",cancer

"That's a really great question! As far as how many different things our immune system can recognize as a target, our immune systems can hypothetically make *trillions* of unique antibodies (here's a great article that discusses this: https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/decoding-variety-human-antibodies).

Of course, there's a lot of variability when it comes to how long our immune system stores that information, and how effective that information is at actually helping the immune system find invaders. A good example are covid vaccines: depending on the part of the SARS-cov-2 protein structure that different vaccines use to tell our immune system ""hey, be on the lookout for this"" (as well as the quantity of mRNA or protein they use, the interval between doses, etc.), they can produce stronger/weaker, longer-lasting/shorter-lasting ""memory"" in our immune systems. 

So could we make vaccines for every disease and every cancer that we have good identifying sequences for? In theory, we could probably get pretty close! But it's hard to say how effective each one of those vaccines would be, how long the immunity from each would last, etc.  It's also possible that some diseases and cancers don't have an easily identifiable ""unique"" piece that we could target with a vaccine! And beyond that, some vaccines get your immune system so excited that their side effects make them *really* not fun to take - in this case, unless you're at risk for exposure to something, it's often not recommended to get the vaccine simply to save you the discomfort.",cancer

Like most vaccines, mRNA vaccines work by providing a ""blueprint"" of an invader that your body isn't very good at recognizing yet. The technology behind these vaccines, though, allows them to be targeted to *very* specific targets. In this case, they're targeted to genetic sequences that are only found in the mutated colon cells that cause colon cancer. 

You're definitely right in that some autoimmune diseases can cause cancer (this doesn't happen to every patient w/ autoimmune disease, but is certainly a possibility). Some examples include Hashimoto's Disease, where your body attacks its own thyroid, and Celiac Disease, where your body attacks the small intestine, both of which can lead to cancer of that specific body area if left untreated for long enough. That being said, the genetic sequence that this BioNTech vaccine targets isn't found anywhere in the human body *except* in cancerous cells :)",cancer

"At this point in time, it looks like the trial is for patients who have recovered from colon cancer, but are likely to experience a relapse - researchers can then, over an extended period of time, compare relapse rates in the trial group vs. patients who recovered and did not receive the vaccine.

If this vaccine passes clinical trials (is shown to be well-tolerated and effective) in this specific use case, it may eventually undergo trials for use in other populations (e.g. before any actual cancer diagnoses in high-risk groups, etc.).",cancer
"I'm in no way a medical professional (I have a Ph.D. in Neuroscience, so while I have minimal background in immunology, I'm by no means an expert) so whether or not *any* medical treatment is right for you is definitely a discussion for you and your doctor.

In terms of *mechanism* differences between Gardasil and the BioNTech vaccine in this article, Gardasil bolsters the immune response to several strains of HPV, a virus, in order to prevent infection later in life. Infection with these viral strains is associated with the development of several cancers, including cervical cancer. As such, giving your immune system the tools to fight it off before it's encountered (a lot of people thus receive the vaccine in early adolescence, as they're most likely to encounter HPV in their late teens / early adulthood) can help prevent fully-fledged infection and potentially the development of cancer later on. It's given to the general population during early adolescence, as it's *very* likely that any given member of the population will encounter HPV in their lives. It's also important to remember that not *every* HPV infection will cause cancer! However, because so many people can have HPV without ever knowing it, preventing transmission over a large population will reduce overall cancer rates in the long run (you can think of this almost like the flu vaccine - not every person who gets the flu will have a case that requires hospitalization, but preventing widespread flu transmission in the community will significantly reduce the number of people who catch it, as well as the subsequent burden on hospitals!).

I don't know the data offhand on how effective gardasil is at generating a sufficient immune response in adults, so once again, definitely a conversation to have w your doctor :)

In contrast, only a small percentage of the population will develop colorectal cancers with a high rate of recurrance. The BioNTech vaccine is thus being targeted at this specific group, which (at the moment) can only really be identified after they've been diagnosed.   The vaccine itself gives the body tools to recognize specific cancerous cells that it has generated before, and destroy them. Thus, at the moment, it's not being tested as a general cancer preventative, but rather as a tool to prevent relapse specifically in people who've recovered. This in and of itself is a pretty exciting concept - one of the exceptional financial and emotional burdens of many cancers (along with many other things) is the concern that they will continue to come back even after initial treatment. The potential to reduce that element is huge!",cancer
"I agree - I'm not in industry, so I also don't have a great base to compare the ORR to (especially in this clinical subset).

That being said, this article seems to be quoting figures from the Phase 1b trial that started back in 2017 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03289962), right? If I understand correctly, this trial targeted a wider range of conditions, including some with advanced disease stages associated with extremely low general response rates across therapies (NSCLC, melanoma). Knowing that, I don't think I'm too surprised that the ORR was quite low? Looking at the additional outcomes, though, they *were* able to generate successful T-cell responses in 73% of patients, which is promising. I'd need to do a lot more digging before I say anything definitive, but I wouldn't be surprised if they looked at the highest responding cohorts from Phase 1b (colorectal cancers) and targeted them specifically for Phase 2. Would love to hear your thoughts, though!",cancer
"Good question. In theory, this vaccine will help patients who've recovered from colorectal cancer avoid the cancer returning after they've finished treatment.

One military sci-fi novel from the 90s that I read featured cancer vaccinations.  They really only come up in the sense of “My god, lung cancer not only still exists in this star system, it’s the leading cause of death”, but I remember the idea seemed so weird to me when I first read about it.

Now here we are with a cancer vaccine possibly within reach.",cancer

At the time I thought it was interesting to think about having a system to alter mood. It's all connected to chemistry and whatnot, so in THEORY, I feel like it could be possible, and that's exciting to think about when I read books.",cancer

The place I was at is making _millions_ just from being able to identify immune-defeating cancer biomarkers from *biopsies*, all in service of prescribing these drugs.

"Agreed except for one point, this isn't robbery, it's just how public benefit programs work and this is why it's important to keep funding these efforts - they save lives.

Robbery will be when they inevitably choose to charge $50,000/dose for a life saving drug that costs them $100 to produce, but that's a separate problem.

We don't accuse UPS of robbery because they use public roads, or Google of robbery because their Maps use public GPS satellites, as long as they operate (relatively) fairly and pay taxes.

There are a lot of problems with our healthcare system, but leveraging public research to privately produce miraculous life-saving drugs is not (directly) one of those problems.",cancer
"What do you suggest then? 


The public sector is good at foundational research but is usually unable to develop the results from foundational research into actual products that are beneficial to humans. Every other week there is a new cure for cancer, Alzheimer's and what have you, which you will never hear about again. That's what the public sector is good at. Occasionally, they find a gold nugget which actually has the potential to be developed further for clinical use. But public researchers think everything they discover is a gold nugget or at least they present it as such. And mostly, they have no interest in refining it further because that's not their field of expertise.  

This is where the private sector comes in. Companies which are backed by investors and have the capacity to bring the results from foundational research to the next level, to conduct clinical studies and mass produce the invention.",cancer

"If
You have a stronger immune system are you less likely to get cancer ?",cancer

I wonder if they could use this to create custom made autoimmune diseases in lab rats for research purposes. If they knew exactly what it was doing maybe it would be easier to figure out how to reverse it.,cancer
I'd guess thisll be in long term trials for a while since it's really not like our current vaccines so we want to know what happens long term.,cancer
"I think you are way overestimating how many mutations cancers typically have in common. For example I quickly looked up Her2 in breast cancer that you mentioned, and the result was ""Somatic mutations in HER2 (also known as ERBB2) occur in approximately 3% of breast cancers"". And among these 3% are several different Her2 mutations, lowering the number even further. So yeah sequencing would have to be done in order to find out the parient's specific mutations.

In the trial mentioned here they are also targeting patient-specific mutations. I am sure they would love to develop something more general, but the options here are extremely limited.",cancer
"Cancer isn't trying to evade the immune system, it's not an independent organism. It's just that it only becomes a problem when it does.",cancer

"While true to some degree, it's likely just not possible to scale to the large number that do exist, and keep stock globally.  Reality is there's a lot of rare cancers in this world.  

Progress so far has been to the common ones.  If you get one of those you're relatively ""lucky"" as there's treatments etc.  Some of them nothing short of miracle cures.  It's crazy just what's happened since 2000.

For those who get one of the less common ones however, it's a huge disadvantage as your doctor is essentially reading tea leaves trying to work with limited knowledge and drugs that aren't really tailored for your cancer.  But that's the economics.  Spend money on the things with greatest impact.  Save as many lives as you can within your research budget.  It's not anyone's fault.

This is something we don't really talk about.  Cancer progress has been amazing and all, but not exactly equitable.  Some cancers, particularly those that impact smaller demographics don't get the same amount of support.

This could change all that.  That rare cancer can now get the same survival rate as the common ones.",cancer

Well you CAN weaponize almost anything.,cancer
How about your parents?,cancer
"Absolutely. Patient specific therapy is the future of all of this. Every patients cancer is distinct, so we’re never going to have a true universal cure, or a preventative vaccine. But the ability to take a patients tissue and make an individualized treatment is where medicine is headed. It’s just currently very expensive and time consuming. Hopefully advancements like this overcome that barrier!",cancer
"Not entirely sure about the delivery, but the concept is the same. In the way that mRNA codes for COVIDs spike, the mRNA in these vaccines codes for tumour antigens you’d find overexpressed on a tumour cell surface. Producing antigen allows the endogenous immune system to be primed to recognize and attack those tumour cells. The concept isn’t new, but using mRNA to do it in this way hopefully can bring down cost and allow it to happen much faster.",cancer
"Of course, that’s what trials are for. Ultimately it’s treating cancer patients, and likely those with aggressive cancer that hasn’t responded to other treatment. At that point, your options are to do nothing and die of cancer, or get an experimental treatment to have a chance at survival. There have been very tragic trial results in the past that a promising therapy in mice resulted in death of healthy trial participants, so there’s a high degree of caution in all things. 

Moving through human trials, especially in the Americas is slow. Luckily, tons of people are working on these sorts of approaches, and the data in the field is incredibly promising!",cancer

Tasmanian Devils are currently suffering a massive epidemic of tumors transmitted by a healthy individual biting an infected individual.

There's also Canine Transmissible Venereal Tumors, which are exactly what they sound like. Researchers have been able to confirm the original cancer came from a Native North American dog breed, with some coyote ancestry, but the cancer cells themselves actually diverged from dogs over 6000 years ago, and are essentially their own, unicellular organism, now.

Who knows if they would've have survived long enough to commercialize their cancer cures if covid hadn't come along. Also, thanks to covid Moderna does not need big pharma financing. They've been able to sidestep the godawful traditional biotech process.

My twin brother was diagnosed shortly after I was with a much lower grade tumour, and due to my own diagnosis, they offered him surgery, which he took, and he's fine now.   As for me, after bone scans and mri, they determined that there had been no spread YET, but that I was a very high risk of a metastatic spread.  I was treated accordingly.

I also had 37 doses of external beam radiation as well, just for fun!

My most recent blood test (last week) has my PSA down to 0.6.  I am not complaining.",cancer

"I'm confused.

5million die yearly from obesity.
10million cancer
23million heart disease
9million starvation 

Meanwhile covid sits at 2.5million. 

I get covid is transmisable, and you can't ""catch"" cancer like you can covid. 
That said though:
1. fat parents raise fat children. 
2. A person with cancer tends to pass on their weak DNA to their offspring.
2. A person with heart disease tends to pass on their weak DNA to their offspring.
3. Poor parents raise poor children. 

Sure, these ailments are not directly transmissable, but they do pass down into future generations.

However i'm also quite positive that all natural systems have limits.

I think your answer is that we simply don't know the limits yet, which is perfectly fine.  Newton didn't know (or cared) that his laws would fail at near speed of light.  My understanding of the immune system is that it generally fights substantial variations of infections every day, but only remember how to produce anti bodies for a few long term, because why waste resources for something that rarely happens.  Only a few vaccinations last for life without boosters.  So why would that be different if we eventually get vaccinated for 1000 different things?  We have never had vaccinations for more than maybe 100 different diseases, and only very few people get most of them.

I think that is a valid question which is just not answered with - ""you don't understand it"".

Would the production of antibodies within the human body full stop at these vaccine hijacked cells? If this is possible, would it potentially put other mRNA vaccines at risk of not working in the future if they do cause neogantigen production if you have active immunity towards neoantigens?  

I don't claim to be the science. I'm just asking questions so someone more qualified can answer this. In my simulation, I just don't think it will work as intended. Then I see studies like this: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8085349/ that mention monoclonal antibodies and their role in passive immunotherapy.

The first experimental chemotherapy used nitrogen mustard (the same chemical as the mustard gas used in WW1). The treatment would slow down tumors but was very much lethal to patients. This is like the Wright bros first flight.

The first truly effective chemotherapy drug, cisplatin was approved for use in 1978. It is now used as a first-line chemotherapy drug in most cancers. Cisplatin slows down most tumors and can completely eliminate some. While it doesn't kill directly, side effects can be severe.

Immunotherapy treatments were developed in the 2010's and, while they extend survival times significantly they are also very expensive since antibodies need to be synthesized. They are also hit and miss since these treatments rely on the patients immune system. Now, in 2022, we may have the ability to directly target tumors...

I love the optimism, I for one am most excited about new energy generation methods; especially something like nuclear fusion; if that becomes a thing we won.

That said, I wonder if it's possible to measure 'progress' in technology somehow. I think if you look at the 2010-2020, it's not that different from 2000-2010 but that's just looking at it anecdotally.

One thing that I think is relevant here, is that in the past individual people would often lead the innovations in all kinds of fields--that's almost impossible nowadays. You have dozens or hundreds of people working on some specific problem, and then maybe a new discovery/innovation/breakthrough arrives. Whereas in the past, a single person could do that all on their own. I'd say in that sense the rate of progress is decreasing; because we need to invest so many more resources, compared to the past to get something new. The counterpoint to this is, that many new discoveries/technologies are now so 'special' that they can change everything, even if it takes a lot of time to get to them.

As far as the real ground breaking technologies, things you might like to see more of in our society, or even consumer products like the smart phone, these are all government researched backed. Sometimes the research goes back 2 or 3 decades before it reaches the consumer market, but the biggest innovations to this day still come from government funded research like the public university systems, the national laboratories, military research. Military research is a huge one and silicon valley is tight with the military industrial complex or a part of it, I should say. So there are a lot of myths about innovation that private industries like tech/pharma more broadly purport, but the reality is it's government research and money that drives innovation. It's been the government's practice and priority for many decades now for once government research reaches maturity that it goes to the private sector so that private individuals can make a profit on it. Public assets paid for by public spending going into the hands of private individuals to sell back to us our very own assets. And that is what has created the silicon valley and big pharma of today that is totally predatory capitalist in nature and the benefits, derived from public spending, are not shared widely.",cancer

[Kaposis Sarcoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaposi%27s_sarcoma) for example is much more common in people who have a weaker immune system due to AIDS",cancer
Your immune system exists and the issue is if there is a mutation in the cancer cells that allow it to evade your immune system. Tumors and uncontrollable cells occur all the time in your body and there are safeguards in the cell and immune system that keeps it in check or destroys it. Exposures to carcinogens accelerate those mutations.,cancer
"One of the biggest killers of AIDS patients is cancer, because they are so immunosuppressed that their immune system cannot properly fight cancerous tumours.",cancer
Your immune system finds and kills cancer cells all the time.,cancer
It’s not so much about your immune system as it is about the cancer and the strategies it used to evadedetection,cancer
"from my understanding, some types of cancer are caused by virus, so a strong immune system will kill it before developing further

also I guess a strong immune system means a healthier body, and that helps to avoid the mutation in the cells to become cancer cells",cancer
Probably the biggest factor in whether you develop cancer or not is a mutation in p53. It's a tumor suppressor gene and in over 50% of cancers p53 is mutated.,cancer
"I’d go so far as to say all cancers evade the immune system. Cancerous cells are killed by the immune system all the time, those that develop into cancer have mutations not recognized by the immune system.",cancer
Would you not simply need some immune modulating medicine and time in bed to feel better? Like... pop some Prednisone and take a week off? Im guessing not but...,cancer
"Actually you are not wrong, (this is just my personal opinion) post surgery tumor patient is the best option for such cancer vaccine as EVEN after you remove the tumor there is still that small % of tumor cells lingering in your body which either you hope your immune system can clear it or thats where chemo comes in to wipe clean slate

That is where I believe cancer vaccine can come in effectively to train your immune and recognise the cancer cells. (We can use the patient tumors to identify what mutations the tumor carries and use that information to create vaccine) then the trained immune cells can finish off the remaining cells in your body and potentially even have post treatment protection.

Anywaya regarding the large tumor, a large immune response (cytokine storm e.g.) is a concern but I believe mainly for those on CAR-T cells where we are introducing potentially large number of T cells into the patients body. 

Cancer vaccine on the other hand introduce the training materials and our body has its own regulatory mechanisms to protect against such large unforeseen immune response (the tumor also have its own regulatory mechanisms to stop our immune system from attacking but that another story for another day). I wouldn't say I would rule out such cytokine storm from use of cancer vaccines but I would just add that using cancer vaccine on solid tumors that is still present is still actively being research on.",cancer
"As far as brain cancers are concerned that is correct. It’s done after craniotomy to kill whatever cells are still left behind. *Gotta catch ‘em all*
Otherwise the swelling would be significant.",cancer
"We still have a lot of work to be done. Most of our trials currently are on those that are post chemo post other treatments before they even start on this cancer vaccine trials. Hence their tumor are said to be more ""modified"" or like immunotherapy such as like cancer vaccine may not work as effective in these patients.

Current trials evidence therefore based on just use of cancer vaccines as single treatment option that it's not very good.

However, I'm optimistic that in the near future (20 years) cancer vaccines can be a common treatment that can complement chemo + other immunotherapy  to create this cocktail that can fight cancer hard and fast but there's still a lot of work left to be done (identifying vaccination mutations targets better + identifying good vaccine delivery method (using mRNA? Using dendritic cells? Using proteins?)",cancer
"The other nightmare thing about cancer is that it's easy to underestimate your chances of getting one because people usually only learn about statistics for a particular version of cancer.

"Im not a Biologist, but I would imagine breeding them would be easier, or do you mean diseases that habe never been seen in rats?",cancer
"Also, how many of these mutations would be visible to the immune system?

Immune cells are not sequencing DNA to find cancerous mutations. Would need to have some kind of expressed difference right?",cancer
"I'm not sure where that number is coming from, but when we were working on it the generally accepted number of HER2 positive breast cancers was closer to 20%. Those also tend to be much more aggressive, so they end up being a majority of treatment-resistant cases.",cancer
"Not only that but HER2 and ER and PR are also important receptors that still have uses in non cancerous cells. A cancerous cell that also produces these receptors to help them grow, is of course a target of existing therapies but with the side effects of also targeting every other cell.

Thats the difficulty with cancer. How do you target your own cells with he exact same machinery as every other cell in your body?

Cancer isn't a virus or a pathogen or a new different thing, its just your cells but with broken growth regulatation mechanisms.",cancer
Do you think we will have a way to prevent a lot of cancers or fight them very well in say… 10-15 years time?,cancer
"It’s not “trying,” but it can’t exist unless it evades the immune response so the effect is the same as trying.",cancer
"Neither are viruses.  Viruses just evolve with random mutation the same way.

The only meaningful difference between cancer and a virus is the ability to spread.  Cancer is much harder to transmit.",cancer
"Sorry, ""off-the-shelf"" wasn't meant to mean ""over the counter"", just that it didn't need to be made custom per person. These sorts of vaccines targeting cancer can have nasty side effects (your cancer is *really* similar to you, so anything that kills it likely affects you somehow) so they'll probably always be prescription.

"It's a crazy rabbit hole to read into. Especially the various strains of it.

The antivaxxers in my social circle have been overwhelmingly into alternative health. These are the people who try and avoid most medical treatment because they believe they can cure things themselves by purifying their bodies. 

What's fascinating is how they play the two truths and a lie game to effectively build their audience. Very basically the stuff I've seen has revolves around:

* The US healthcare system is a profit driven mess. 

* Preventative healthcare is important. Eating healthy, exercise, and mental care will vastly improve your life. 

* Therefore almost all mainstream healthcare is bad and we can cure corona with oregano oil. 


And I'm like ""Hell ya!"" to the first two things, and that's what they spend most of their time talking about, but then it just flies off the rails. 

There are no shortage of actual doctors who promote this stuff too. The lead organizers of the groups I found are actual doctors. They confidently provide very complex explanations to things that I know are BS, but there's no way myself as a laymen could disprove everything (and they spray out a lot) on the fly. This confident pseudo science presented by alternative authorities draws in a lot of gullible skeptical people who gathered to watch the antivax movement on the fence. 

Religion plays a big part of it and on the extreme ends the physical and spiritual world is considered equal. God designed humans in a perfect system. Sin takes us away from God and away from that system. Cancer, illness, whatever, is often the manifestation of our failures to stay within God's system. We can cure many diseases by just going back to the basics in food and healthcare, and trusting God.  

It's not hard stuff to disprove (one of these docs, a real practicing doc in Cali, tried to say the 90%+ unvaccinated rates at hospitals was a great example of correlation doesn't equal causation...) but you have to know how to research, how to interpret things, how to find the holes in the logic, and if you're just not one of those people and already think the mainstream is lying to you... good luck trying to convince them with anything but hard cold real life experience. They've found the authorities that back up what they believe and they'll doggedly hold onto them.

If anything my nursing friends have told me is remotely true, cold experience only helps a tiny amount of people see the light. People really really fucking don't like to admit they're wrong. One of my friends had to just practically overdose a covid patient with morphine because she refused intubation (I DONT HAVE THAT FAKE PLAGUE) but was physically suffocating with so little oxygen. Morphine just knocked down the drowning reflex until she eventually effectively suffocated to death.

">Fully vaccinated people get covid.

For the exact same reason that people who have had covid can get covid again.

Immunity against SARS-CoV-2 wanes over time, no matter *how* it was acquired. The vaccine just leverages the exact same biological mechanisms as the immunity acquired from being infected, so of *course* it has the same reduction in efficacy over time.

Do you have a point here?",cancer
"“Science, You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.” -Inigo Montoya",cancer
"I am not really qualified to answer this fully either.  But basically the mRNA needs to be ‘encoded’ to represent a flagging part of the disease, usually just a part of a surface protein, so that the immune system can ‘recognise’ it, and produce antibodies against it.

The effectiveness of the vaccine depends on analysing the disease surface proteins, and reproducing a large enough chunk of it, for the immune system to uniquely recognise it’ while also being small enough to have no adverse effect itself.

Usually it’s a tiny, tiny part of virus, that really has zero effect on its own.  It’s a requirement for this to work correctly that the analysis is for only the target virus, and only a part of its surface proteins.  Because that is so specific - like a fingerprint, it should not react to anything else.

We see this problem in reverse with covid - as it mutates and changes, the vaccines are no longer as effective, because the ‘fingerprint’ of the virus has changed.

If it changes just a little, the vaccines still work, but too much change, and it’s no longer recognised as the same thing.  This is why the vaccines need to be adjusted and updated over time.  Because they are so specific.",cancer

Also this: 

""There are a number of safe sunscreen products currently on the market in the U.S. where Europeans might have Americans beat is UVA protection, says Dr. Joshua Zeichner, a New York-based dermatologist. “Some of the ingredients used in Europe give better coverage over the full-spectrum of UVA light, which is not fully covered by the products we are using in the United States,” he says. A 2017 study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology supports the claim, finding that of 20 different U.S. sunscreens tested, almost half did not meet European standards for UVA protection, though most met the U.S. standards for it.""

The lucky thing is that—as we learn more and more about how the immune system interacts with cancer—it turns out that a lot of the mutations don't actually matter for this kind of treatment. The diagnostics I was working on were about identifying which immune-defeating proteins a given cancer was expressing so an appropriate immune therapy could be prescribed.",cancer
"Hah, yeah. That's a big question with a lot of layers, and I only know a few of them myself. I'm not a doctor or researcher, just a biotech-enthusiast software designer who had to learn a bunch of the science to do a job. :)

The bit I know: when cells mutate, *normally* they either die or appear obviously unhealthy to other cells. When that happens a ""killer T-cell"" will more or less eat the defective cell.

To become cancer, the cell needs to mutate in a way that both makes it grow out of control *and* convinces the immune system that it's healthy. Often this will be via a protein on the surface of the cell that acts as a ""checkpoint protein"". That's basically a passport for the cell that says ""I'm fine, don't kill me"". Normally they're an important part of protecting you from your own immune system. ""PD-1"" is a good one to look up if you want to dive into the science of it.

In this case, they appear to have found 20 mutations that produce similar proteins. They are *acting* like a checkpoint protein, but are not *identical* to the normal ones in your body. Just like how the spike protein can change a bit but still work to let COVID into your cells.

So they're going to use the mRNA to produce copies of those impostor proteins with ""this is actually bad"" markers attached to it. The immune system learns to attack that protein instead of ignoring it, and starts killing the cancer.",cancer

"I work on developing longitudinal disease monitoring technology (pancreatic & colorectal cancer). We use CTCs as biomarkers. I think I would disagree saying that ctDNA isn't a specific biomarker. How is it not? Eventually you are able to find the most prevalent mutations in that patient. That's why there are panels for common mutations and then you can do exomic sequencing to find rearrangements of tumor DNA compared to normal DNA.   
And surely they also sequenced the solid tumor so they have an idea of what mutations they need to be looking in the ctDNA. After all, you need to distinguish the ctDNA from cfDNA.

Yes you don't see ctDNA in patient blood and go ""aha! yes, X cancer, treat with Y"". You extract the DNA, amplify & sequence and then get a picture of that particular patient mutational status. Also if you monitor the same patients over time, you can see changes in DNA. For example, in my work, we have seen patients develop particular mutations after months of a specific chemotherapy.
And this is probably why they require patients to have detectable ctDNA, so they are able to see if the mutations are going away/changing. 



It's one of the advantages of CTCs, since you can just extract the DNA from the CTC and amplify + sequence that. Less work than the extensive library prep for rote ctDNA analysis. (Still need library prep for DNA analysis from CTCs, but we know the mutations from the solid tumor and can just have primers for that).",cancer

Now, what virus famously messes up the immune system? HIV! Now that your immune system is not functioning, you're susceptible to a multitude of cancers that a normal person would never get, known as ""aids defining cancers"" because if you get that cancer, you're no longer considered HIV+ but now full on aids. 


Now another thing to keep in mind. Viruses are freaky little buggers. They are basically rogue DNA / RNA that have like no purpose. Kinda a glitch in the matrix.

"I read an essay by Ray Kurzweil a while back and he laid out his calculations (estimates) for the non-linear progression of technological advancements relative to time.  We have the unfortunate habit of viewing things historically where we go okay in the year 1900 things were x way, and now in 2000 they are 2x way, I can reasonably anticipate that the same level of progress will happen in the next 100 years I.e. we will go from 2x to 3x.  This is a mistake because technologies compound upon each other and accelerate.  To your point of this 66 year gap, 66 years before 1903, 1837, the American civil war was in the distant horizon, electric motors had just been invented, anesthesia was still 5 years away.   By Kurzweil’s estimations (which are somewhat subjective because you can’t really quantify technological progress as a number in the same way you can, say, compare transistor density) the years 2000-2100 will see 10000 years of technological development relative to the 20th century time scale.

Yes and no. While it is an amazing timeline, airplanes and rockets are entirely different technologies. So it's not like we needed the Wright brothers to unlock powered flight in order to progress to rockets. That groundwork was laid by people like Robert Goddard (and a few others) in the 1920s. They began by building what would be similar to non-orbital pro-hobbyist rockets today, that would only fly dozens of feet off the ground initially.

The second generation of rocket scientists were headlined (unfortunately) by the Nazis, with their V-2 rockets, which passed the Karman line, the well-accepted edge of space. That worked continued after the war, with the scientists being absorbed by the US/Russia, where the space-race kicked competition into overdrive, and the rest is history.

That doesn't make it any less fascinating how quickly we went from early rocketry to landing on the Moon, but tying the path to the evolution of airplanes doesn't really work. :)",cancer

"Vaccines aren't always prophylactic. 

In the past years (a decade or so) we've found that the immune system is actually really good at killing cancer provided that the immune system actually recognizes the cancer cells as foreign. There's a ton of research into how cancers escape the immune system, but suffice to say, they do. If you can stimulate an immune response against something that the tumor has but your body does not, your immune system will then kill whatever that thing is. So the idea of mRNA vaccines for cancer is that the patient has cancer with some suite of mutations that aren't being detected by the immune system. We give that patient an mRNA vaccine that is personalized to that individual patient's cancer, which causes the immune system to mount a response against the vaccine. This in turn primes the immune system to attack anything like what the mRNA vaccine introduced, which is the cancer.

The magic of this technology is that you can vaccinate as many times as you want. Targeted therapies often fail to provide long-term protection against cancers because often the tumor just reverses the mutation and pivots to a different oncogenic mechanism. For mRNA vaccines, if the cancer comes back because of this, we can just design a new mRNA vaccine for that patient and give it again. 

Probably, the tumor will run out of oncogenic pathways to mutate before we run out of mRNA vaccines to give to the patient. This fundamentally flips the race against time that we've suffered in the battle against cancer - whereas before we had to aggressively treat cancers before they became resistant and metastasized, but with mRNA vaccines we have limitless targets against the tumor and theoretically can just keep vaccinating until the tumor is dead. This last paragraph is a bit of speculation, admittedly but I am super excited for it.",cancer

And more generally speaking. Does mRNA always trains the immune system to ""kill"" or can it be used with mRNA also to ""accept"" those new proteins.

Luckily cells can often tell when they are becoming cancerous and will either kill themselves or signal to the immune system they need to be destroyed. This happens every day in your body.

Serious cancers happen when even these secondary checks start breaking down.

The whole problem is that cancer is not an invader, its portions of the body becoming unregulated. The immune system has to distinguish between friend and foe and cancer generally appears as friend.",cancer
"It's a really promising future.

One neat thing about cancer vaccines is that they don't have the same limitations as when you're trying to prevent a viral infection. Eg. You can take a cancer vaccine *after* you get cancer and it'll still work.

In the future I can imagine a world where each person gets a handful in advance, based on their genetic profile, then get regular blood tests to make sure they haven't developed anything unexpected. 

Eg. If you're a woman with certain genetic markers your chance of getting chemo-resistant breast cancer is extremely high, to the point they often recommend double mastectomy as a preventative measure. But it's of a predictable type, so it would make sense to give a vaccine for that type as a preventative. For folks without that marker, it's likely better to wait and only treat what actually develops.",cancer
"A virus or even a bacteria doesnt have any more agency than a cancer cell does. Every cell on earth today exists as a result of millions of mutations and ""bugged sequences"" that have yielded the incredible variety of organisms we have today.

Lastly, saying""cancer doesn't exist in the first place, it's not an entity"" is meaningless and pedantic word salad.",cancer
"Eh. You're correct from a technical standpoint, but from a practical standpoint it can act *really* similarly to an independent organism. 

It's a group of cells that has somehow evaded the immune system and is growing out of control. They grow, mutate and evolve based on threats.

A biological error might be the cause, but the effect is something closer to a parasite. The thing that makes them so tricky to treat is how similar they are to the host.",cancer

Question:  Why would the body mount an immune response based on the vaccine component if it can’t mount a response to the cancer component itself?,cancer
Thank you!,cancer
"So I'mma do second first. mRNA just tricks cells into making proteins. It could theoretically do anything from make insulin to killing a cell, depending on what instructions you put in it. There are markers for ""this is bad"" that we know, and we stick those to things to make mRNA vaccines. I'm not aware of an opposite that says ""this is good"". If there was, we'd probably be seeing it used to treat autoimmune diseases.

The first one is... tricky to explain, because it's a very alien concept for us.

Basically, the receptors on your cells are ""feeling"" for specific parts of a protein. They don't see it, they more... touch it in specific places. If it fits and they ""feel"" the right things in those places they assume they have the right protein. But they don't necessarily touch *all* of it. Just certain parts.

Like imagine an extra long counterfeit key that fits your front door, but also has a bunch of extra notches in it. Some are tiny and in between the notches in a regular key, and some are on the extra part that doesn't fit in the lock. But your door can't tell that the extra notches are there, right? It's not built to look for them. So you could have lots of different keys that all open your door, but the rest of the key is totally different.

Now imagine you made a key 
-destroying robot, and showed it the whole fake key _including_ the extra notches. It could know to destroy that key. But it wouldn't destroy your normal key, because it's only destroying keys with all the extra notches you showed it.

"> A counterargument to that is that there might be a limit to human ingenuity. The amount of time it takes for researchers to learn enough to reach the cutting edge of their field will only get longer and longer as time goes by.

This has already been the case for centuries. There was a time where one could legitimately be a ""scientist"" in the broad term - some people made significant contributions in multiple fields of science which are either unconnected or very slightly so.

The answer we've had for a long time now is specialization. The more complex a field gets, the more narrow someone's niche can become. We used to have just ""chemists"", but now we have a slew of jobs such as ""organic chemist"", ""biochemist"", ""theoretical chemist"", etc. As our body of knowledge grows, we'll just separate these specializations further and further.

"Keep in mind that it has been several years since I took an immunology course, but here is my greatly abstracted explanation. It is much more nuanced and complex than this but as far as I know this is the general idea:

>where did it get trained from

It gets trained by a team of special cells that float around and ""surveil"" the molecular landscape of your body. Those special cells have a memory of ""self"" molecular patterns that are present on the healthy cells in your own body. They also have a memory of ""foreign"" molecular patterns they've seen from previous microbial invasions. Think of these ""memories"" like ancestral memories - all surveillance cells share the same memories, whether they were present for the actual invasion or not. These surveillance cells constantly float around and check to make sure everything they find their patrol matches what's in their ""self"" memory. 

In the event they find something they don't recognize, or if they find something that matches a pattern in their foreign memory, they sound the alarm and a huge cascade of different events takes place. This is your immune response. One of the many things that happens is the surveillance cell will bring the foreign molecular pattern back to HQ where it can be recorded into the ancestral memory database for all surveillance cells to reference on future patrols. This is how they get trained, and likewise this is the mechanism through which all vaccines work.

>why can't we equally get the immune system to unlearn things if we can make it learn things

Let me ask you this: think of a personal memory that is meaningful to you. Ok, now unremember it. Did it work? 

I'm sure there are many people working on this problem but it is very complex. The ancestral memory I mentioned above is encoded in the DNA of your immune system's memory cells. Specifically ""removing"" memories without affecting anything else is something we may not be capable of doing for hundreds of years (if ever). But who knows.",cancer

"From what I can tell, your body finding and attacking cancer cells is finding mutated anomalies that aren't necessarily directly harmful as regular maintaince, and more like sniping out home-grown terrorist with a couple odd tendencies amongst a whole city, long before they even do anything that is an act of terrorism. If it works properly anyways. An inflammatory immune response recognizes something foreign, or recognizes its own tissue as foreign, and uses an inflammatory response, which is more equivalent of carpet bombing everyone who vaguely resembles your terrorist, or just the whole city too. And this works properly too, for big illnesses and toxins, it is a life saver. It's when our body's ""recognition"" systems go wrong that we got trouble. When these things go wrong, the analogy equivalent is your body changing definition of terrorism on you, and suddenly this protection system is a big problem because of the sheer complexity and inability to get rid of threats, or killing civilizations with the threats.

Cancer isn't necessarily an inflammatory response by your immune system, like it would be for an autoimmune, but that being said they are pretty linked, and cancer does have the ability to be inflammatory even if it isn't inherently so. Autoimmune is inherently pretty inflammatory. 

The way I see it, autoimmune is when your body *overrecognizes* healthy tissue for a threat and it *overesponds with inflammation*, but with cancer the issue is the the body's *inability* to see its own tissue as a threat, and so *it doesn't respond at all*

Increasing our capabilities is how we would bypass the current human limit. After all, when we can change sex or height as easily as we currently can dye hair, I don't know what our limits will be.

"The book *Black Box Thinking* touches on this a bit. Progress comes from iterative refinement *and* huge paradigm shifts. We both make what we have incrementally better (refining within the same general mechanism) and at times, jump entirely to new mechanisms. Computers are an easy example of this - DVDs hold more than CDs, and BluRays hold more than DVDs, but NAND (flash memory) is now a ka-jillion times better in terms of value delivery in almost all metrics *and we keep making it better*. Within NAND we've started stacking chips and accessing them in different layers (SLC vs TLC vs QLC for you nerds), but then there are jumps to different designs (z-nand, 3d-xpoint) that are mechanism shifts that need their own refinement.

I think I happened to see the announcement the day it was released. I signed up that Friday (3 weeks ago?) and they called me the following Tuesday. I think all of the locations were looking for something like 500 participants. I believe Royal Free was hoping to have the first round of shots for all 500 done by next week?

Yes - they monitor you for 30 min after giving the shot. You are there for 2 1/2 hours and the last half hour or so is just waiting while they monintor to ensure there is no adverse reaction. Prior to that they are reviewing the program with you, testing you for COVID, provide you take-home COVID tests in the event you feel like you have COVID like symptoms in the future. They have you download an App in the event you come down with COVID like symptoms during the trial becuase they want you to provide updates via the app. They take blood, measure blood presure/temp, weight/height. Once you are done they schedule the 2nd shot with you 3 weeks out. The 2nd visit is supposed to be short.

Second dose just gave me the sore arm again for another few days. 

So I’m fairly certain I got the real deal rather than the placebo but I can’t be 100% certain and so I tried not to let it change my behaviours.

I had my third appointment two weeks ago where they took blood. I told the Dr about the side effects I had experienced and she said a lot of people on the trial had the same side effects.

Still not sure if I had the vaccine or the placebo.

I'm also part of the ONS study where I get tested every 2 weeks and all my tests have returned negative.",covid

Second dose I felt unwell within a few hours. Nausea, chills, shakes and dizziness. Temperature of 38.3, so ended up having to go for a COVID test (negative). Symptoms disappeared within about a day, and then I had some pain in my lymph nodes on my vaccination arm for about 2 days.

Of course there’s no telling whether I really got it, the placebo effect can be strong.",covid
"I had mine today. I'm pretty sure I got the real. One, because I had a small local reaction and had to take benadryl before I left the clinic.

First shot, I felt a sting while being injected but no side effects. 

I had my second shot yesterday and felt the same sting then nothing until about 5 hours later. My arm was really sore. Today after the Tylenol wore off my arm was sore again. No other symptoms. 

Initially I thought I received the placebo but with my arm being so sore after the second shot, maybe I received the real vaccine. Only time will tell, for now I will continue as if I received the placebo.",covid
"I'm in the US trial. Had my second shot today. 

First shot I got no local reaction. Nada, zip, nothing. I struggled to find where they had injected me. 

Second shot about 14 hours ago. When it went in I felt a slight burning and that feeling of a foreign substance in my arm. It's 2am now and it's not unusual for me to wake during the night. But the pain in my arm is enough that I just took some Ibuprofen. Feel like I've been kicked in the arm. It radiates down to my middle finger and back across my shoulder blade. 

It's nothing major but enough for me to say that there's no saline shot that's likely to feel like this. Enough to Google on Reddit for Novavax vaccine trial.

We were told today that in a couple of months we will cross over. Whoever got the placebo will get the the vaccine and vice versa so that everyone will have had the vaccine. It will be interesting to compare reactions.

UPDATE: It's been a week since I had my second shot and my arm is almost back to normal. Day 2 felt like I had been kicked in my arm. It hurt to move and to touch. It wasn't debilitating, just felt like I'd had a shot. It slowly got better. By day 4 it just hurt to touch. It wasn't a sharp pain, it was a dull ache and I didn't need to take anything for it. Right now if I press lightly on my arm I can find a tender area where they injected me. It was never anything more than you would expect from a vaccine.

I did have an intermittent headache from around day 2 to 4, the same as after the first shot but I'm under a lot of pressure at my job and I'm prone to stress headaches so it's hard to link that to the vaccine.

No other symptoms though so still don't know if I had the vaccine and it won't change my behavior anyway. I'm working from home, I have everything delivered and wear a mask, shield and gloves when I do leave the house. I'm just curious to know if I have had it.",covid

"I am currently in the US clinical trial and received my first jab in January. After the initial shot, my temperature only increased 2 degrees Fahrenheit the first evening and my arm was sore for about 3 days. These initial reactions were not bad enough to take any pain killers or fever reducers. 
The 2nd jab, 3 weeks later, was a different story. Within a minute the injection site felt like I had been stung by a bee and lasted for about 5 minutes and turned into mild soreness. After being observed for 30 minutes without any additional side effects I was released to go home. I felt fine and went to bed without an elevated temperature. At 11pm I woke up sweaty, nauseous, throbbing pain in my arm, headache and feverish. Upon getting out of bed I was dizzy as I walked to the bathroom to throw up. I took my temperature and it was 102F. Basically, it felt like I had the flu and I was unable to sleep the rest of the night. The next morning I called in sick to work and my temperature had dipped to 101.7F. Another curious side effect emerged later that afternoon about 24 hours after the injection, the site of the injection had a rash about 70mm wide with several additional smaller patches as well as a metallic taste in my mouth. 
All together the fever, headache, body aches, nauseousness lasted about 2 days. I was well enough to go snow shoeing in the mountains on day 3.  The rash and sore arm lasted 5 days. 
Because I am in the trial, I’m not sure if I received the placebo or the vaccine.",covid

But risk is not binary. Risk must be managed in accordance with the condition. 

There is a small but realistic risk that your car could catch fire and explode every time you drive it. You could get into a car accident and die. Yet driving gives a very big quality of life improvement and people are willing to take that risk.

The same applies to medicine. Every time you take a medicine, even one that has passed trials, there is a small but realistic risk you could suffer some unknown side effect. But many drugs do provide a distinct quality of life improvement powered by statistical data with a confidence level that it is generally safe for the population.

If you were on a medication for say, kidney failure that might require your dialysis interval to be every two days, and I offered you to trial a medicine that might increase that interval to 1 week, with only a minor difference in known side effects, that has been extensively tested in the lab and on animals, is that an attractive proposition? Sure looks attractive to people doing dialysis every two days, no?

Whereas if you were on a drug that has your dialysis interval every 5 days, is the attractiveness the same to you? Maybe not, right?",other

"It was a small trial, just 18 rectal cancer patients, every one of whom took the same drug.

But the results were astonishing. The cancer vanished in every single patient, undetectable by physical exam, endoscopy, PET scans or M.R.I. scans.

Dr. Luis A. Diaz Jr. of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, an author of a paper published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine describing the results, which were sponsored by the drug company GlaxoSmithKline, said he knew of no other study in which a treatment completely obliterated a cancer in every patient.

“I believe this is the first time this has happened in the history of cancer,” Dr. Diaz said.

Dr. Alan P. Venook, a colorectal cancer specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved with the study, said he also thought this was a first.

A complete remission in every single patient is “unheard-of,” he said.

These rectal cancer patients had faced grueling treatments — chemotherapy, radiation and, most likely, life-altering surgery that could result in bowel, urinary and sexual dysfunction. Some would need colostomy bags.

They entered the study thinking that, when it was over, they would have to undergo those procedures because no one really expected their tumors to disappear.

But they got a surprise: No further treatment was necessary.

“There were a lot of happy tears,” said Dr. Andrea Cercek, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and a co-author of the paper, which was presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.

Another surprise, Dr. Venook added, was that none of the patients had clinically significant complications.

On average, one in five patients have some sort of adverse reaction to drugs like the one the patients took, dostarlimab, known as checkpoint inhibitors. The medication was given every three weeks for six months and cost about $11,000 per dose. It unmasks cancer cells, allowing the immune system to identify and destroy them.

While most adverse reactions are easily managed, as many as 3 percent to 5 percent of patients who take checkpoint inhibitors have more severe complications that, in some cases, result in muscle weakness and difficulty swallowing and chewing.

The absence of significant side effects, Dr. Venook said, means “either they did not treat enough patients or, somehow, these cancers are just plain different.”

In an editorial accompanying the paper, Dr. Hanna K. Sanoff of the University of North Carolina’s Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, who was not involved in the study, called it “small but compelling.” She added, though, that it is not clear if the patients are cured.

“Very little is known about the duration of time needed to find out whether a clinical complete response to dostarlimab equates to cure,” Dr. Sanoff said in the editorial.

Dr. Kimmie Ng, a colorectal cancer expert at Harvard Medical School, said that while the results were “remarkable” and “unprecedented,” they would need to be replicated.

The inspiration for the rectal cancer study came from a clinical trial Dr. Diaz led in 2017 that Merck, the drugmaker, funded. It involved 86 people with metastatic cancer that originated in various parts of their bodies. But the cancers all shared a gene mutation that prevented cells from repairing damage to DNA. These mutations occur in 4 percent of all cancer patients.

Patients in that trial took a Merck checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab, for up to two years. Tumors shrank or stabilized in about one-third to one-half of the patients, and they lived longer. Tumors vanished in 10 percent of the trial’s participants.

That led Dr. Cercek and Dr. Diaz to ask: What would happen if the drug were used much earlier in the course of disease, before the cancer had a chance to spread?

They settled on a study of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer — tumors that had spread in the rectum and sometimes to the lymph nodes but not to other organs. Dr. Cercek had noticed that chemotherapy was not helping a portion of patients who had the same mutations that affected the patients in the 2017 trial. Instead of shrinking during treatment, their rectal tumors grew.

Perhaps, Dr. Cercek and Dr. Diaz reasoned, immunotherapy with a checkpoint inhibitor would allow such patients to avoid chemotherapy, radiation and surgery.
New Developments in Cancer Research
Card 1 of 6

Progress in the field. In recent years, advancements in research have changed the way cancer is treated. Here are some recent updates:

Pancreatic cancer. Researchers managed to tame advanced pancreatic cancer in a woman by genetically reprogramming her T cells, a type of white blood cell of the immune system, so they can recognize and kill cancer cells. Another patient who received the same treatment did not survive.

Chemotherapy. A quiet revolution is underway in the field of cancer treatment: A growing number of patients, especially those with breast and lung cancers, are being spared the dreaded treatment in favor of other options.

Prostate cancer. An experimental treatment that relies on radioactive molecules to seek out tumor cells prolonged life in men with aggressive forms of the disease — the second-leading cause of cancer death among American men.

Leukemia. After receiving a new treatment, called CAR T cell therapy, more than a decade ago, two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia saw the blood cancer vanish. Their cases offer hope for those with the disease, and create some new mysteries.

Esophageal cancer. Nivolumab, a drug that unleashes the immune system, was found to extend survival times in patients with the disease who took part in a large clinical trial. Esophageal cancer is the seventh most common cancer in the world.

Dr. Diaz began asking companies that made checkpoint inhibitors if they would sponsor a small trial. They turned him down, saying the trial was too risky. He and Dr. Cercek wanted to give the drug to patients who could be cured with standard treatments. What the researchers were proposing might end up allowing the cancers to grow beyond the point where they could be cured.

“It is very hard to alter the standard of care,” Dr. Diaz said. “The whole standard-of-care machinery wants to do the surgery.”

Finally, a small biotechnology firm, Tesaro, agreed to sponsor the study. Tesaro was bought by GlaxoSmithKline, and Dr. Diaz said he had to remind the larger company that they were doing the study — company executives had all but forgotten about the small trial.

Their first patient was Sascha Roth, then 38. She first noticed some rectal bleeding in 2019 but otherwise felt fine — she is a runner and helps manage a family furniture store in Bethesda, Md.

During a sigmoidoscopy, she recalled, her gastroenterologist said, “Oh no. I was not expecting this!”

The next day, the doctor called Ms. Roth. He had had the tumor biopsied. “It’s definitely cancer,” he told her.

“I completely melted down,” she said.

Soon, she was scheduled to start chemotherapy at Georgetown University, but a friend had insisted she first see Dr. Philip Paty at Memorial Sloan Kettering. Dr. Paty told her he was almost certain her cancer included the mutation that made it unlikely to respond well to chemotherapy. It turned out, though, that Ms. Roth was eligible to enter the clinical trial. If she had started chemotherapy, she would not have been.

Not expecting a complete response to dostarlimab, Ms. Roth had planned to move to New York for radiation, chemotherapy and possibly surgery after the trial ended. To preserve her fertility after the expected radiation treatment, she had her ovaries removed and put back under her ribs.

After the trial, Dr. Cercek gave her the news.

“We looked at your scans,” she said. “There is absolutely no cancer.” She did not need any further treatment.

“I told my family,” Ms. Roth said. “They didn’t believe me.”

But two years later, she still does not have a trace of cancer.
Correction: June 5, 2022

Using information provided by a patient, an earlier version of this article misstated which year a participant in a drug trial was diagnosed with rectal cancer. Sascha Roth was diagnosed in 2019, not 2018.",cancer

"So a couple points to note here. First, this drug (dostarlimab) is already approved to treat advanced endometrial cancer with the same mutation as in this trial.  That approval is for late stage cancer which is really hard to treat. The complete response rate was ~13% which is still really good for late stage cancer. 

The second point is that this trial was for earlier stage disease. While 100% response is a great result, remember that typical treatments at this stage will also have a very good response. It would be great to see a controlled trial to validate how much better the response is with this drug vs standard of care. Additionally, a big concern for early stage patients is recurrence. As we get more time to follow these patients, one of the telling pieces of data will be how many of them recur and when. 

There are a couple other agents with the same mechanism of action (PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor) that I know of with specific indications for dMMR mutations: pembrolizumab and nivolumab. Again, both of these are for late stage disease, and while their indications are more broad they both included colorectal cancer. I don't know if they've been tried in earlier stages. 

All this is to say that while these results are promising, the concept (either the drug or the biomarker) isn't really new or revolutionary. This could be one more in a long string of incremental victories in fighting this disease which is absolutely important and worthy of celebration, but it's unlikely to be a permanent solution for many patients.

No test we’re done because I was told I was TOO YOUNG to even be considered a colorectal patient even though all the symptoms were there. Many young people are presenting late stage colorectal cancers because their symptoms aren’t being taken serious simply because they are too young! And by the time it’s really present it’s basically too late in terms of staging. You should NOT have blood in your stool! Do not take no for an answer and get multiple opinions.

"NY Times article says 18 patients, the actual paper's results summary says 12. Ummm, okay? The same drug was given to patients with stage II and III rectal cancer, and ""remission"" is determined via follow-up exam which ranged from 6 to 25 months after the completion of treatment. So, does this 0% remission rate actually mean anything significant in this case?

Well, one study found that from 1994–2003, the 6 month to 5 year recurrence rate for stage II rectal cancer ranged from 4.5% to 6.4% and the rate for stage III colorectal cancer was 9.9% to 11%. ([https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/29/12/2710/71983/Estimating-Population-Based-Recurrence-Rates-of](https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/29/12/2710/71983/Estimating-Population-Based-Recurrence-Rates-of)). So, if these numbers were still relatively accurate today (I'd assume they'd be lower due to treatment advances, but we'll go with them for now), you'd expect this study to have at most 1, maybe 2 people get remission after 5 years. But the study only did follow-ups a little over 2 years at most.

So, it seems a bit too early to be drawing conclusions from this study.",cancer

"Seems like something that would just happen once in a while.  The drug was effective and treated a lot of them--and then by statistical fluke the others went into spontaneous remission.

Edit: my spelling is horrific.",cancer

"Seems like they also all had cancers with a specific DNA mutation that covers about 4% of patients, and they were treated failry early.  

Not a sciencer, but the way I read it, the reason they all had rectal cancer was likely mainly because that's the patients they had easy access to (and with cancers that all shared the same DNA-mutation).    
This treatment might work for all early stage patients where the same cancer-DNA mutation is present, only in early-stage patients with rectal cancer or (potentially/hopefully) against a wider range of cancers/mutations.    
    
Either way it seems very promising for a specific group of patients, and if we're lucky it might also work well on other groups as well.",cancer
"I think the big difference here other than the fact that these people were treated earlier in their disease progression than other immunotherapy trials, they also **hadn't yet been treated conventionally**. 

Conventional treatments lead to a severe damaging of of the immune system and most trials require that patients have already tried not only one of them, but several. I am always surprised when they are like ""Why isn't immunotherapy working?"" Uh...I don't know maybe because you destroyed the patients immune system? 

Some of the most successful immunotherapies have involved melanoma skin cancer. My suspicion is that one of the reasons for that is the fact that chemotherapy is completely innefective against that cancer so immunotherapy patients are not required to destroy their immune systems first. But what the fuck do I know, I am just some dude who is scared shitless of cancer.",cancer
"It is a checkpoint inhibitor. These have been succesful for some time now. So this is not a previously unknown mechanism of action. But the response rate in this trial is surprisingly high.

"I am currently undergoing pembrolizamab, about 8 months in. I was 3 months from death before being diagnosed and now I've literally lost 95% of the tumors in my liver, no evidence of cancer in my lymph nodes, and shrinkage of over 40% in my largest tumor. I was just diagnosed in October of 2021 with stage 4 colorectal cancer with metastasis to the liver. This is the first time I've seen an article on reddit talking specifically about my treatment. It's truly life saving for me. My oncologist told me at my last appointment I'm actually one of the best results to this treatment she has ever seen. I've never undergone chemo, radiation, surgery etc.",cancer
"It’s important to note that these 18 patients DID have a very important correlation. They all have something called mismatch repair deficiency in their cancers. This leads to the tumors having a very large number of DNA mutations. This, in turn, provides more “neoantigens” for white blood cells to recognize and attack the tumor cells specifically.

It has already been known for a few years now that such patients respond extraordinarily well to PD1 inhibitors, which was what was used in this trial. So it’s actually not surprising that the numbers are really good - just that 100% is naturally quite high - but not completely unexpected. With more numbers it will probably settle down closer to 70-80% based on similar other trials, which will still be great.",cancer
"If this treatment works 50% of the time, the chance that *this specific trial* had 100% success rate would be 0.0004%. But given that there's likely thousands of thousands of these trials over the years, the chance that at least one of even just 5,000 such trials got 100% success rate on 18 patients with a 50/50 treatment would be 2%, so pretty bloody likely given there's far more trials that have happened than 5000.",cancer

The medicine might have an effective rate of 50% and by chance 9 people went into spontaneous remission.

Spectacular. This is what we hope for in the biz. Glad to see pembro having strong effect,cancer
"PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have been approved for 10 years now, and are approved for a wide range of cancer types. When a drug is first approved, it's usually only for the sickest patients, who have experienced no improvement or who have relapsed after trying a few different treatments. They are sick overall, both from having cancer for a while, and from the accrued adverse events of their treatments. 

Once a drug shows efficacy in very sick patients, they can begin to try it in less-sick patients, moving up to first-line (that is, the initial treatment, not a last resort). Because they work so well in some sicker patients, it stands to reason that they will work even better in the newly diagnosed. BUT, of course, they often work best in people who either carry specific mutations, or their tumors have specific mutations (your tumors can have further mutations your healthy cells do not.) So some patients see no benefit, while some are actually cured. 

It's fantastically encouraging!

Case and point: there is a cure for Hep C that’s been on the market for like the past 8 years and the treatment regimens can cost between $40k-$95k. These companies can charge these prices ( in the US at least) because they have patents to these drugs. The money is in the patents, not the drug. 
Also, you’re thinking about  just the money for the drug itself. Think about the extra $$$ from people investing in “the company that cured a cancer!” via stocks and whatnot. Don’t forget the public good will that company can wave in our faces while jacking up the price of insulin.

"> BUT, of course, they often work best in people who either carry specific mutations, or their tumors have specific mutations (your tumors can have further mutations your healthy cells do not.) So some patients see no benefit, while some are actually cured. 

Worse still, tumors are often composed of different strains of mutated cells with different resistances to therapies. So some targeted therapies will kill a lot of the cells in a tumor and it'll look great at first, but the few cells left over are resistant to that therapy, and with all of the other cells gone they have a big space to grow into and no competition. After a few months the resistant cells can grow back into a new, worse kind of tumor that's now full of cells resistant to that treatment.

"Given that cancer is a very broad space, I will admit I have a lot of gaps in my understanding. I'll do the best I can. 

So we started out on cancer with chemotherapy, which is now generally used to refer to cytotoxic therapies and the like. Basically that's just poison that's engineered to hopefully kill the cancer cells faster than everything else.

Chemo over time has itself gotten a lot more effective while causing fewer and less severe side effects in many cases. But we have a lot of these targeted therapies now that go after specific signals which can work well against certain mutations. An example would be EGFR/ALK in lung cancer which work really well for patients with those mutations. Because a lot of these therapies are more targeted, they cause less collateral damage. It's still very much a mixed bag, and while these PD-1 agents are generally less toxic than traditional chemo (and even a lot of the other targeted therapies) they definitely still cause a lot of side effects.

Now this is still a win for sure. But even if this is the case, if it's only studied with the goal of being better than standard of care it may not get approved. You can set a study up to show non-inferiority instead, so basically you can do just a well as something else, but maybe not better. The selling point here is usually better side effects, but relatively few studies go for this outcome.

I believe this treatment is also an infusion, so you go to a center every few weeks to get your IV with the stuff. That can have it's upsides and downsides vs pills.

Basically most treatments for T-cell ALL are directed at particular mutations to inhibit them or potentially fully eliminate them as long as a patient has that mutation present. Monoclonal antibodies such as Daratumumab and Bortezomib are already used for multiple myeloma, but it is not clear how effective they might be in treating T-cell ALL.

That said, typical cost paid by insurance is much smaller. One benchmark would be how much Medicare reimburses; I found [this](https://www.mdedge.com/gihepnews/article/129079/rheumatoid-arthritis/medicare-payments-set-infliximab-biosimilar-inflectra) from 2017:

>For the first quarter of 2017, the payment limit set by the CMS for Inflectra is $100.306 per 10-mg unit and $82.218 for Remicade.

In that context, it's much more affordable when paid for by insurance and/or Medicare. And the same will likely be the case if/when this medication makes it to market: the uninsured will be gouged (with ""kind and benevolent"" plans through the manufacturer for those that can't afford it), while insurance will pay out something rather closer to the true cost of manufacturing.",cancer

1. This is not a cure for cancer even in this study.

2. Your pessimism is likely fueled by the number of things you hear about that you never hear about again.

You have breast cancer, you have rectal cancer, you have lung cancer, we've been on this model for a very long time.

You have cancer in your lungs that is due to mutation X, you have cancer in your breast that is due to mutation Y, you have cancer in your rectum that is due to mutation Z.  Or maybe you have cancer in your rectum that is due to mutation X, or Z2.

Just naming the type based on the mutation instead of where it is found is likely to be a hard fight, but a necessary one.

Because until we get there, you'll still get people who go 'oh, you have lung cancer, we treat lung cancer this way', instead of going 'oh, you have cancer in your lungs, we need to run some tests to see what kind, so we know how to treat it'.

Absolutely nobody should be _denied_ getting the standard of care.

But that standard is usually incredibly slow to update.  If it has been updated in the last decade for something, you're doing pretty good.

Medicine has been advancing a _lot_ faster than that, and the lag between 'this works and saves lives' and 'we've updated the standard of care' can, and absolutely _does_, kill people.

Having the information is unfortunately only a small percentage of the battle, but we are on the right track! Perhaps my favorite discovery thus far is all the non-cancerous diseases that we never knew were linked to genetic mutations. There are even hundreds of millions of people in the world who metabolize all kinds of drugs differently than we sver expected.

Cancer is sort of both - it's a group of diseases defined by abnormal/uncontrollable cell growth that can metastasize (spread through the body). That's a single biological phenomenon, but because it can affect different types of cells in different ways, we break it down into carcinomas, sarcomas, leukemias and lymphomas.

I'm sorry that you are having to live with those neuropathy symptoms.

"Are you familiar with Moore's Law? It says the number of transistors on an integrated chip will double every 2 years. The tech world has seen that play out fairly accurately since the mid sixties, and everyone started worrying that we were approaching the theoretical limit to transistor size, meaning the end of this predictable climb. Without the anticipated increases in computing power, we were facing a wall that physics couldn't get us around. 

Just recently, a new ""Gate-All-Around"" transistor technology was announced. Right now, we can get up to around 6 billion transistors on a chip, but with this new technology, they're predicting 30-50 billion on a chip. 

Those plateaus are very serious roadblocks to any development, and that's why tens of thousands of researchers in every field, including cancer research, are working on ways to leapfrog our technological abilities to keep us from ever having to face those plateaus and veer into divergent approaches that could be ethically dubious. Things like CRISPR gene editing, advanced stem cell treatments, nanotechnology, dendritic cell-based immunotherapy, etc. allow us to look at cancer treatments in a new light, offering much more highly targeted treatments that are exponentially more effective. Researchers are overcoming the ""Moore's Law"" of cancer treatments every year with incredibly innovative ways to target and destroy cancer cells and keep their work ethical.",cancer

"I’ve learned the hard way that $8,500 is now a “reasonable” out-of-pocket max on top of a $5,000 deductible and $400/month premium. 

My insurance policy is antiquated and has a low deductible/premium/out of pocket max. It was grandfathered in and is no longer available, so I’ll fight to keep it, however...

My father lost the same plan when he retired a couple of years ago, so he had to find something else. He had a massive heart attack two months ago—88% mortality rate, but he somehow survived 11 hours before getting help. Despite the severity of his heart attack, he had relatively little intervention—no ambulance; just an ECG, two stents, and a night in the ICU and another in the general population. He figured that since he didn’t need open heart surgery or other higher-level care, he might survive the bill, too. 

It turned out that his insurance has tiers, and each has their separate deductibles and out-of-pocket maxes. He just paid $20k out of pocket, and he still hasn’t met the maximum—but he remortgaged the house and drained his entire retirement account, so there’s that. 

The heart failure medication he takes is $600 a month. He may need it for the rest of his life, and we still don’t know whether he’ll need a pacemaker.

"There will always be complaints about health care, but I think you could ask any non-American whether they want an American system, or an Everywhere-Else system, and you will receive the same answer every time.

I'm Australian. We have public and private health care. People can choose to go to private hospitals, and pay their own insurance if they like, or they can stay on the public health system (or both). Private medicine is useful because - for a fee - you can skip long wait times for surgeries, and sometimes receive better or more specialised treatment. But if you need help, you get it, and it will be free or very low cost. This generally means people receive medical care when they need it, and more preemptive care means a healthier overall population.

Either way, the problem with American healthcare is that it is economically deregulated. Anywhere else, you get treated, and treatment is covered by a healthcare plan. You aren't bankrupted by medical costs, because insurance companies and hospitals haven't conspired to blow out costs. Even paying fully out of pocket for medical care is cheaper anywhere else, because prices of medicine are regulated. Many governments negotiate medicine prices with pharmacos on behalf of their people, which gives them the power of collective bargaining.

"> Is this true Canadians?

Categorically not. Some particularly rich people may do this, from time to time, and for very specific types of treatments (often to a specialized health care facility) but it's virtually unheard of.

We do however bitch about our system - it's not perfect and some provinces manage it better than others. But I can count on my hand the number of people who look at the American system with envy. We tend to instead compare ourselves with other countries with socialized health care and wonder why we can't have something equivalent to theirs.

As for the quality it's hard to gauge but in general outcomes are better or the same for most kinds of cancers (a few minor exceptions for some very narrow kinds of cancers for which the specialists largely reside in the US). Actually our outcomes are better on almost every metric than the US when it comes to health care. Notably in relation to access to health care. In some regards, particularly w.r.t. infant and maternal mortality rates the US compares to third world countries.",cancer
"My father pays a bit more for a private clinic, but when he needed to see them at short notice, they told him three weeks until he could get an appointment... So he went to the ER.

"A Narcoleptic from Germany here - there's usually a difference between public and private insurance, where the latter is more expensive and many doctors also have more slots for people with private insurance. So you might have longer wait times. But since most doctors also need to have a specific number of slots for patients with public insurance, it doesn't seem to be a huge issue unless you need some kind of very dedicated specialist.  

I'm publicly insured and due to my chronic illness I have to visit a neurologist with specialization in sleep illnesses regularly, and never had an issue finding a new doctor after moving to a new city - I always easily got a new appointment within 3 months at most, and the one time I moved through half the state I was even able to get an appointment within two weeks.  

Although I think the most prominent difference to the US healthcare system might be the cost:  
I have to take Xyrem and modafinil to treat my narcolepsy, and for that I have to pay ~40 - 50€ per month - 10€ per package, since that is all anyone has to pay for prescripted medicine. Together with the monthly cost for my health insurance, I pay about 200€ per month for anything health-related.  
The co-pay for medicine is also capped at a few percent of yearly income. Everything above that gets refunded by the health insurance at the end of the year.  

The one time I was hospitalised for a couple of days as a kid, my parents' health insurance even paid us ~50€ (100DM at the time) for each day I spent in the hospital.

Alright, I'm going to level with you.  You've got a tumor in your brain.  We think it's cancer, but we have no idea what _kind_ of cancer.  For cancers found in the brain, about x% is this kind of cancer, which usually responds well to that kind of treatment.  But sometimes it's this other kind, or that other kind, and neither of them respond great to that.  They _do_ respond to some other treatments, but we really can't just take a biopsy and see what kind it is, because that would probably kill you.  So we're going to start the treatment for the common one, and if that doesn't work, we'll know that it's probably not that type and move on to the treatment for the others.

Is that especially good news?  Hell no.

But it correctly _sets expectations_.

The cancer isn't 'beating you', it's not some lack of internal strength that's preventing the treatment from working, you knew from the _start_ that this treatment was only going to work if it was the common type.  And you have _already had_ the conversation about what other types it might be, what the treatments are for them, and when you want to give up on treating it like the common type and start trying treatments for other types.

For that matter, it lets the patient consider options, like having conversations with family about how, if it turns out not to be the common type, when is it maybe worth it to tell them to take the damn biopsy even if the biopsy procedure is pretty risky in itself?  Hell, if you have a family history of cancer in the lungs, and you happen to _know_ that it was a given type for one of them, even if that was only learned after death, that has the potential to be a pretty valuable piece of information, even if we have no bloody clue what the genetics are that make that type more likely in your family.

"I feel like America is a lot closer to a multi-payer system that works than popular narrative would have us believe. Anyone with decent insurance will have a max out of pocket of 8k for the family, and I've had insurance where my max out of pocket was closer to like 2500 for an individual, 5000 for a family. That maximum out of pocket was less of a percentage of my salary than the ~5% public option would've been - and if needed it would be funded by a tax-exempt account called a health savings account. 

A public option, medicare-for-all-who-want it style, is all that's needed to help close the gap for those who don't have access to a good employer plan. Everyone is covered and people can still shop for specific plans that fit their needs. It would also force insurance companies to compete with the public option, meaning the most predatory plans (such as those with extreme out-of-pocket limits) would be weeded out.",cancer

">Here in Ireland we have universal healthcare whilst also having every major drug company in the world on our shores. 

You're right, you do. You're a small country so you've got that luxury.

Let's do a thought exercise. Let's say you're making lemonade, and the cost to make a glass of lemonade is $1. You've got 10 neighbors that regularly buy your lemonade. 3 of those neighbors have set a cap on the price they'll pay for lemonade at $1, they won't pay a penny more. 7 of them have not and simply pay the market rate for lemonade, which is $1.20.

For every $10 you spend, you expect to make $1.40 or 14%. Not a bad business, definitely comparable to what you could earn putting your time and capital into something else.

Now let's assume that the other 7 neighbors institute a hard cap at $1. For every $10 you spend you make nothing. Will you keep producing lemonade? Nope.

Drug manufacture is a little more complicated because companies will accept payments that generate gross margin but aren't profitable, which is different than selling it at cost, but for this discussion its the same thing. The US doesn't really cap drug prices, which is great for the rest of the world - we're the 7 neighbors paying market prices and keeping the market healthy.",cancer

">	Why do you think that PD-1 inhibitors are dependent on HLA phenotype? PD-1 is expressed by virtually all T cells.

“Considering their critical role in conditioning T-cell immune-priming and CTL-mediated tumor cell killing, it is reasonable to believe that differences in class I and II HLA haplotype could have an important role in conditioning either outcome and/or irAEs in patients receiving PD-1/PDL-1 blocking mABs. There is clear evidence that tumor cells that acquire a homozygosis status for class I HLA by deleting one of the two parental allele genes become partially invisible. Therefore, they become refractory to PD-1 rescued immune effectors since they present a much lower number of epitopes available for CTL recognition [12]. Class I HLA upregulation induced by exposure to either gamma-interferon, cytotoxic drugs or ionizing radiation was able to enhance tumor cell susceptibility to specific CTL clones, which supports this hypothesis [13,14].

https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/10.2217/imt-2019-0160

Just to be clear though, what I said was that the clinical evidence seems to suggest that HLA variation is the primary driver of the diverse efficacy of checkpoint inhibition, not the only one. Like I said above, I didn’t read the study, and my comment was a hypothetical about a way in which this result (remission observed in all subject) wouldn’t exactly be remarkable in terms of new information if the subjects were selected based on favorable genotypes.

And just to clarify, I wasn’t at all trying to downplay your expertise with the TED talk comment, I just didn’t know if you mi t be simplifying over something that is central to my point, which again is that if you were to select patients based on a genotype you know is highly compatible with your checkpoint therapy, a big remission outcome isn’t exactly surprising.",cancer

"As others have said, it was a medicine for morning sickness that caused birth defects like babies born without limbs, but that doesn't do justice to why it's the poster child for rigorous, overly cautious testing of medicines and procedures.

See, like many organic molecules, thalidomide had two molecularly-identical versions called isomers. Think of isomers like your hands; they're structurally the same, but nonetheless aren't the same because they're mirror images of each other. You might not think that would matter and neither did the European regulators. In thalidomide's case the isomer they tested was a powerful anti-naseua medication with no adverse effects. But the *other* isomer produced horrific birth defects instead. Because the manufacturing process produced equal amounts of both isomers mixed together the pill was distributed as equal parts both.

" Not just in Norway. Because public healthcare is triaged, non urgent things can end up with long wait times. It's not first-come first-served, it's treat the worst first and everyone else can wait.  

Eg. I once had to wait in hospital for 3 days to have surgery on my hand because there were lots of car crashes and people dying that pushed in front of me in the queue. Was quite a nice holiday TBH, just watching TV and reading books and getting meals brought to me.   

Unfortunately this means lots of preventative stuff, particularly mental health, can be quite difficult to access in many places. However, if you're suicidal or a danger to others then it's fast. Generally though, the system sucks for mental health beyond what your local doctor can do. There are some exceptions: Victoria Australia for example, provide all citizens with up to 10 (iirc) free subsidized therapy sessions each year.  

Here are some examples of mental health in a public system that I personally know about (some were my friends or family:  
  
1.My local public doctor can prescribe me antidepressants and it would cost me about $30 for the appointment and prescription, and maybe a $5 fee at the pharmacy.  

2. To get prescribed Adderall I have to go to a psychiatrist, a family doc can't prescribe large doses of addictive shit (a week's worth of tramadol or diazepam I think is about the max they can do). However they can sign off on repeat prescriptions after the psychiatrist has diagnosed. Because ADHD isn't life threatening, the public waiting list for the limited public psychiatrists would grow faster than I'd move down the list, so I'd have to go private. It'd cost me ~$250. Repeat scripts (from local doc) + pharmacy costs would be like $10/month.  

3. I'm suicidal. I can walk into any hospital and will be seen by a professional and given some antipsychotics and counseling within a few hours usually. Sometimes I'd have to wait in a waiting room for 3 or 4 hours first. It would cost $0, but be a very basic level of care.  

Or I could go to a private shrink-  although they're usually booked out weeks in advance,so I'd need to be a very patient suicidal person. It would cost a few hundred dollars.   

Or there are government funded suicide prevention hotlines to get you through the crisis, then counselors can take over until you get a pychiatrists appointment - which would be fast if a therapist/counselor said it was necessary.  

4. I'm addicted to meth and I want to go to rehab. I can pay $250/week to go to rehab. The government provides funding to cover the other costs (and audit the center annually).  

Or I can go to a private rehab. It's $2400/week, but they have nicer food and I'd get more one on one counselling sessions (rather than group sessions).   

I think that's all pretty good, and while there's lots to complain about and the service is faster/better with private options, the public sector does the job most of the time.  

Related fact: my government spends less on healthcare per capita than US government spends, yet hospitals are free and everything else is subsidized (except dentists and chiropractors).   That's how messed up the American system is- more of your taxes go to healthcare but most people don't get anything from it.",cancer
"American healthcare spending on R&D is 6% of overall healthcare spending. It does not explain why healthcare costs are so insane in America. That's a very small percentage of overall spending and doesn't explain why healthcare in the US costs about twice as much as the rest of the developed world.

"This isn’t my area of specialty — I just provide talk therapy — but it’s something I read about from time to time. Note that the following is my personal interpretation of research articles/news articles/colleague statements and is not meant to be therapeutic or medical advice. 

My understanding is that while genetic testing for identifying psychiatric medication exists, the evidence of its efficacy is rather weak. I’m not sure whether that means there’s improvements to be made in testing or if genetics aren’t a significant enough factor in treatment efficacy, but there you have it. There are companies that are more than happy to take your money — GeneSight is one I’ve heard is pulling ahead in terms of testing efficacy — but some people would caution against throwing even more money at something that may not get you closer to a “perfect fit” treatment. 

If you’ve never been on medication before, it may be difficult to get tested, let alone have your health insurance cover it. I believe genetic testing is more likely to be authorized for people whose psychiatric illness has been deemed “treatment resistant” by a prescriber (GP, NP, psychiatrist, etc.). “Treatment resistant” can mean all sorts of things, but a common threshold I’ve heard is trying two medications for at least six weeks each without any change in symptoms. The genetic testing industry also seems to be particularly targeted at people with more nuanced or uncommon psychiatric diagnoses. 

So if you feel depressed or anxious, it may be wise to just stick it out and play “medication roulette” rather than sink a ton of money into testing you may not even need. You might be surprised at how effective the big-name drugs like Zoloft can be.",cancer
"Generally speaking, research that gathers more granular data is more useful because there is more information and a greater number of variables to control for. It’s also more expensive, because it demands more time of research participants (necessitating greater compensation) and of the researchers (lab assistants are generally paid hourly, and more data to collect and comb through means more hours working). Many studies also use data collection methods that cost money, such as a questionnaire that researchers pay for per copy, which adds up if you have a large sample size or many questionnaires. 

There are many types of research designs, but the government typically prefers large sample sizes because it’s cheaper to implement something that works okay for lots of people rather than amazingly for a few. Because of this, treatment-focused research generally starts out with case studies and small-N longitudinal designs before being rolled out for study in a larger population. It’s basically saying, “hey, we spent $50 and found that this treatment allowed us to make $100 and help somebody, so give us $500 and hopefully we’ll help 10 people and make $1000.”",cancer
"Yes. Here is how:

Say you are suspected to have cancer (you have the symptoms, you go to a doctor and get examined. They agree with your concerns and have some tests done.)

The tests they give you may be something like (blood, urine, cheek swab, etc.. whatever is best test for your specific cancer; say if you are suspected to have Leukemia, they will test your blood, since leukemia is a blood cancer).

Within leukemia, (and every other type of cancer), there are subtypes of cancer. So you may have leukemia B or leukemia T. 

As it turns out, these different types of cancer have different treatment modalities. 

If you are determined to have X,Y, and Z category of Leukemia -- this treatment might be the best for you! If you only have X and Y category -- other options might be better. 

It will depend on the availability of drugs. You may have a cancer that has something that is untreatable. Or you may have one that is super easily treatable. Some may be under study, and you can enroll for clinical trials for trying out drugs. 

The hard part of the science is figuring out what sort of treatments work on specific types of cancers. And tbh, people enrolling for studies is what drives the science forward. Medical Science is an ever evolving and learning field.

As for the corporate aspect -- yeah I hear you. It is pretty messed up. That would first start with an overhaul of the entire political and lobbying system ... check out this [video](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyFuckingVideos/comments/v04v45/new_gop_rep_mo_brooks_says_prime_committee/)",cancer
"Sure can be done cheaply and sustainably. Remember, you'd only do this to people who have been diagnosed with cancer, so it is a much smaller population set. Some commenters here are conflating the idea of genetic sequencing every person's whole genome. I'm not talking about that (that *would* be expensive). I'm saying that everyone with cancer should have their cancerous cells genetically sequenced to find the DNA aberrations which caused it. Cancer genome sequencing costs about $2K, running a report on it to find FDA approved drugs cocktail combos to attack the mutations is about $1K. That's cheap compared to any cancer treatment.",cancer
"The system is fucked indeed. Insurance, banks, etc... all a big scam against the little guy.",cancer
"Oh, definitely understood on sequencing the cancer genome.

But the cost of whole genome sequencing on people has been dropping like a stone.

And frankly, that's _while_ it's at fairly low volume.

Even if you gate it as only for people with active medical problems, $1000-$2000 to sequence it, _once_, in a person's lifetime?

That really isn't expensive, _especially_ if it lets you catch something early, or if it guides you to the right treatment a bit faster.

Now, to be clear, my view of the medical system is extremely biased by being chronically ill with a hereditary connective tissue disorder (among other things) that didn't get diagnosed until my mid to late 30s.

But it's not like we don't routinely spend absurd amounts of time and money fumbling around in the dark trying to figure out what's wrong or how to treat it in a fair number of people.",cancer

>These price discrepancies and their implications are well known throughout the industry but rarely discussed outside of it. Pharmaceutical companies have long defended the high price of drugs as necessary to pay for the research and development of new drugs, but the differences in pricing essentially means that consumers in the U.S. are contributing more than those in other countries.

A fair number of the things that we screen for in _every_ child would be covered by this, as would various recessive genes that sometimes people only find out about when they have a child that turns out to have horrible problems, because both parents were unknowingly carriers.

For that matter, there's a significant push to do genetic testing in the UK before proscribing a decent number of common medications, because to some degree you can see how you will metabolize many drugs based on your genetics.

"There’s no reason for the government to be competitive. They are the government. We needed a vaccine fast, those companies were already working on RNA vaccines, the government is setup to rely on companies, so the fastest way to get the vaccine was to pay them. The argument isn’t that the government has to do everything for us to have a sane healthcare system. The argument is that the healthcare companies shouldn’t have free reign to charge whatever they want for medical care. 

These companies would exist either way, they sell their vaccines to other countries with more rational healthcare systems, and they have to charge what the countries tell them they will pay for it. This is why socialized health care has up to 40% cheaper cost for the same things America gets. 

No, these companies don’t need to profit a hundred billion dollars a year to make medicine. They do it because they can.",cancer

After the first week it started to hurt. After the second week the dentists were saying to take more than a double dose of ibuprofen, and keep taking more unless my ears started ringing. By the time three weeks were up there were moments where had to sit down from the pain.

Six months after they removed the tooth I was back for a check up. I asked the dentist if the experiment was a failure and she sort of smiled and said that it was going into wider clinical trials.

"Not quite a clinical trial, but in the mid 80s my father was one of the first people to accept a new hayfever vaccine - he'd suffered badly year on year. Few weeks later, he started losing weight, feeling fatigued and just generally being ill; he was admitted to hospital and, after what he describes as hundreds of medical tests failed to find any reason for why he was ill, the best they could come up with is that somehow a heterosexual man who had never used drugs or had a blood transfusion had somehow developed AIDS (remember, this is back when it was still being called GRID.) It was just assumed he'd get sicker and sicker until he died, but one day he started to get better, which also stumped the people researching AIDS because that hadn't happened to anyone else, the eventual conclusion being they didn't know what it was but it can't have been that. Doctors basically told him he seemed fine now, just get on with his life.

He went back to get the vaccine again the next year, but was told that it had been withdrawn after loads of people died after having it.

"My mother in law participated in a large scale trial of aspirin being tested as a cure-all for the elderly. The pharmaceutical company was trying to prove that everyone should take aspirin daily beyond a certain age to reduce blood clotting. Coincidentally it's also a great way to sell a lot of aspirin. 

My in-laws were both part of the trial and my mother in law had some medical issues that ended up involving internal bleeding. If she hadn't been on aspirin she would have been ok, but due to the blood thinning aspect of the aspirin the problem escalated badly and she ended up vomiting blood all over her hospital room and nearly died. It's hard to describe the feelings of horror and helplessness watching her vomiting blood on the floor while nurses rush into the room from everywhere, telling you to stand back and take emergency action to try to stop her dying. One of the nurses later told us that we were extremely lucky that she lived. 

A few weeks after her near death experience a group of people from the pharmaceutical company showed up unannounced at their house and ever-so-gently pressured them into signing a waiver withdrawing from the trial and saying they wouldn't sue. Being nice trusting elderly people they signed it. We later found out that the whole large scale trial had been canned that same day. 

Since they got her agreement to withdraw it won't be recorded in any official report that the trial nearly killed her - just that she withdrew from it. The whole thing really stank in my opinion. I imagine that they want to keep their options open to run more trials in future so they didn't want her negative result hanging over them.",other

I had the worst, heaviest, painfull periods I had seen since before I started taking other birth control. But it was really only bad for two days a month so I could live with it.

"I took part in a trial for renal denervation; they destroy the nerves running from the kidneys in order to reduce blood pressure.  This involved an angiogram which is a wire threaded through the artery in my groin up to my kidneys where ultrasound is used to ablate the nerves running alongside the artery. 

A previous trial was halted in the past because both the placebo group and the group having the procedure showed a drop in blood pressure.  Apparently there are so many factors involved in BP regulation that even a sham operation can have an effect. 

So this new trial was double blind.  Only the surgeon would know if the machine would actually be switched on and all 300 participants were to have an angiogram. 

My operation failed.  It was abandoned when they discovered that my artery branches and is wider than 4m.  This means any nerves are outside the ablation zone. 

But they didn't discover this until I was laying naked in an operating theatre, with my crotch shaved, under sedation, with a wire threaded into my groin. 

When they pull out the wire, the hole is sealed with a collagen plug.  This involves the surgeon pulling the wire until blood spurts out of my artery, then pushing down into the crease of my groin with all of his weight to activate the plug and seal the wound.  Despite being under sedation I was flailing and yelling because it was so painful.  They put me further under and I woke up in a pool of blood.  

This is all normal.  Look up angioplasty on YouTube if you want to watch how it's done. 

I am extremely disappointed that they couldn't destroy the nerves as I really, really want to be free of blood pressure medication.  I am now on a trial researching how the nitrites in beetroot reduces blood pressure. ",other

"Was in a clinical trial for a PTSD medication. Double blind but I figured out pretty quickly I was in the control group. I then un-blinded myself to my main researcher at the end, telling him I knew I hadn't been receiving the test medication and why I knew it. Listed my evidence. Just to be an asshole. Never joined a clinical trial again. Fuck clinical trials. 

Edit: Wow the downvote love, I'm feelin it! 

As clarification, this wasn't a trial for multiple sclerosis or cancer, as has been mentioned. And anyone who has been through a clinical trial knows that you're pretty much cattle. You're there to prove or disprove the hypothesis, not as an individual under the care of another individual. For that reason, and because I personally don't find PTSD an effective target of a clinical trial, I will not be returning to clinical trials. 

They certainly exist for a good purpose for severe medical conditions and diseases. And if I had some agressive, awful disease I probably wouldn't care about the impersonal aspects. 

Finally as others have said, pretty sure my researcher didn't really give a fuck what I said or which group I thought I was in.",other

"Working in the regulatory part of the research field, I hear comparisons like that pretty often - basically 'this is a terrible diagnosis to have, so the side effect profile of this drug isn't the best, but it's one of their few options.' Sometimes in those exact words or very close. Obviously everyone wants the medication/treatment to have as few side effects as possible, but if it's death vs... well, a lot of other things, you want to give patients options.

Then if it happens during the trial, you pull out the history, remind the subject what they said before, and then ask, ""is this different than usual?"" If no different, include that in the note (in which case it's not captured as an AE, because it's the subject's history), and if it is different, record it as an AE unless it is milder than usual, in which few cases I've had this, I inform the medical monitor and ask them how they want me to capture it.

You are afflicted with a condition and you want to know that you are being treated with something that will give you a chance to live a close to normal life.

They are necessary for marketing approval by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. There are of course conditions (infection, epilepsy) where it is unethical to randomize patients to receive a placebo (you would never give a patient with an infection a placebo). In those cases, you have an active comparator, where patients receive the standard of care instead of placebo, and your experimental treatment is compared against that.

His first symptom was a crazy bad headache. I have known him for 20+ years and he never gets headaches, so this was a big warning sign. He went to the doctor after 3 days and told them he thought it was malaria and they basically didn't take him seriously. This was also at the time when the Ebola virus was blowing up in Africa. 

The big problem came after about 8-9 days and I watched him drink liters of water and still be thirsty and not needing to pee. Then he collapsed at home. Took him to urgent care thinking maybe they can give him IV fluids - they couldn't even register his blood pressure it was so low. The UC doctor called 911 and the firefighters who responded first couldn't even get a blood prick for a blood sugar test.

He was rushed to the ER where they confirmed within the hour that he had malaria. He finally was able to pee about 6 hours later and it was essentially the color of very, very dark tea - almost black. He was then transferred to ICU.

The next day he was yellow! Yellow eyes, yellow skin, yellow hands. He was septic.

Actually that’s not the case.  There are placebo controlled trials which compare a new drug or treatment to a placebo.  In this case the placebo is null treatment.  Many of these types of trials have procedures in place to provide placebo patients with standard treatment after the trial is over.  Then you have comparator trials where a new drug or treatment is directly compared to an existing drug.  Neither is inherently unethical although both can be problematic for different reasons.

My reaction was that 1 in a million that has to be mentioned, but is so rare, it never happens outside of clinical trials.

The reason I like what my parents do is because we get to help people with medical conditions but honestly most of the time the people we help is because they need the money so the join research studies.

In order to start a business like this you either need the knowledge or the funds. If you have the knowledge you can find someone to fund your project. My dad was the one with the funds and learned a long the way. Learning came at a cost and I’m talking hundreds of thousands of dollars.

"Well, at the three month check-up, I felt extremely fragile. One of my friends accidentally poked me lightly in the chest on one of my first outings and I literally blacked out from the pain. This was when my surgeon said I would be able to play football if I wanted. I complained. He told me that sometimes it takes longer, and to check back in three more months. 

I cover my chest with books or my arms everywhere I go. 

Three more months go by and I feel like I can poke my chest without excruciating pain, but as I increase the force with which I poke myself, it’s clear from the pain that any direct hit would be horrible. And I can still only sleep on my back. I tell him, he says it looks great, but sometimes it takes longer to heal. Check back six months for a one-year checkup. 

In the mean time, I get ultrasounds and different scans and x-rays done. They all look fine. 

One year check-up, I can take a decent hit, but I can’t sleep on my side. If I roll over in my sleep and stay on my side for more than a couple minutes I wake up in awful pain. This pain feels like one half of my ribs is about to slip under the other.  It’s horrible and has never stopped in all this time. I tell him this and he says that in very rare cases it can take longer, and that it’s getting better so just wait and it will slowly get better over the next year. And “it healed beautifully,” “looks wonderful,” etc.

Two year mark I see no improvement at all. This is when I cry and tell him it was a failure. I interrupted him when he was calling it beautiful. I felt like nobody believed me even though it was making my back hurt constantly, leaving a dent in my bed from sleeping in the same spot every night. Making me an insomniac.

Yes, HIV is entirely treatable now. While you still lose a few years of life expectancy, you generally have the same as the general population.  Drug resistance is happening though, and we’re finding more resistant strains all the time. So, it might not be treatable forever. 

As an example, my old lab worked on CRF19, which is the most aggressive strain ever found. Progression from HIV to AIDS when untreated usually takes 10 years, with this strain it takes 3.

""Two types (species) of parasites, Plasmodium vivax and P. ovale, have liver stages and can remain in the body for years without causing sickness. If not treated, these liver stages may reactivate and cause malaria attacks (“relapses”) after months or years without symptoms. People diagnosed with P. vivax or P. ovale are often given a second drug to help prevent these relapses. Another type of malaria, P. malariae, if not treated, has been known to stay in the blood of some people for several decades.

Same with snakes (~70,000). They're venomous, but most are curable if you can access medical care quickly and avoid infections, and will avoid you if you don't mess with them.

Crocodiles try to compete (they're both in the 2-3000/year death range allegedly), but as carnivores at least they have a decent excuse.  

Sharks round out the list, but at only ~10 deaths per year they get a bad rap, mostly due to Jaws and Shark Week. It's not their fault we can look a lot like seals sometimes while swimming or surfing.

"Agreed. Pain perception is a very subjective thing, one person experiences the same stimulus as much more/less painful than their matched peer. This can make it hard for a trial employee to accurately gauge whether someone is truly in pain and needs to be dropped. Further, without a review of the encouraging language used, it is very difficult to say that the IRB's ethical guidelines. In fairness, telling someone to keep taking more ibuprofen until they hit a dose that makes their ears ring (if that's how this was actually meant), is at least dumb. I'm not sure how someone in a trial would know that there had been drop out, but I know with certainty that pilot data is used to calculate necessary sample sizes. The calculated sample sizes are typically determined and presented as ""the sample size was chosen to be 90% powered with 30% dropout rate"" kinda thing. Drop out isn't something you avoid, you attempt to predict it and preempt it. If the trial continued to later stages, it is likely the researchers achieved statistical power, making claims about drop out rates being high unlikely, IMO. ",other

The second one was fascinating from a tech standpoint and because I’m in tech I had a different perspective to offer. I ended up washing out of the trial on that one because I had a “low that needed assistance” (aka I woke up on Christmas morning with my nextdoor neighbor firefighters in my bedroom cramming glucose gel down my throat while my OTHER Paramedic neighbor was rocking up with his bag and getting ready to mainline me.

It was an experience. The first week I was told to not use bolus at all but continued with basal. I had quite a few highs but none of them was stubborn and came down within a few hours. 

They adjusted the mix (I don’t know what it contains as that was not shared) every week after extensive blood tests and a complete med checkup- my day was Mondays and took all day. I’d leave with the adjusted shot with instructions for the week. By week three I didn’t have to take basal. 

There was a week I had horrible lows and I was picked up at home and kept for two days on a drip. By Christmas I took zero insulin and I stuffed my face after a tentative two days of dipping my toe in the water and watching the numbers. I never went above 9mmol and it dropped within three hours to normal - around 5.5 to 6.5 range. That’s where the pounds came from and I don’t regret eating as much as I did. I was severely scolded but that just slid off my back.

"The following submission statement was provided by /u/Dr_Singularity:

---

It was a small trial, just 18 rectal cancer patients, every one of whom took the same drug.

But the results were astonishing. The cancer vanished in every single patient, undetectable by physical exam, endoscopy, PET scans or M.R.I. scans.

Dr. Luis A. Diaz Jr. of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, an author of a paper published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine describing the results, which were sponsored by the drug company GlaxoSmithKline, said he knew of no other study in which a treatment completely obliterated a cancer in every patient.

“I believe this is the first time this has happened in the history of cancer,” Dr. Diaz said.

"I posted this on another thread regarding this article, and just wanted to put this information here as well.

Just wanted to give some background as an oncologist. Very exciting data for this patient population, but I want to to clarify what this trial truly studied. We have been using immunotherapy (in this case PDL-1/PD-1 inhibitors) for years in many different types of cancer (lung cancer, colon cancer,  melanoma, genitourinary cancers, liver cancers, you name it). As the years have gone by, it's gained approval in more and more cancer types.

The important thing this study was evaluating was using it as a neoadjuvant therapy (before surgery essentially) in patients with early stage rectal cancer who express what we call a mismatch repair deficiency. Meaning there's specific genetic abnormalities that we see in this patient population, and these genetic abnormalities are only seen in a small fraction of patients with this disease. The goal of this study was to see if surgery could essentially be avoided without changing outcomes in  patients who had a complete response.

We know already that immunotherapy works very well in colon cancer with these genetic abnormalities. It has been approved as first line therapy for patients with metastatic mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancer for years, and while I have seen great results (people years out from treatment with no evidence of disease), the response rates in metastatic disease is much lower. Typically 40-50%. 

So while this is amazing data that may save patients with early rectal cancer from having to undergo curative intent surgery following immunotherapy and chemoradiation, I just want to share how the scientific community actually interprets this data. I want to acknowledge how incredible some of the results have been that I see with these drugs. They have been a gamechanger for oncology these past several years. With each new study, I'm hopeful we'll find more ways to utilize them and save lives in doing so.",cancer

"Cancer Research - Discovery of Small Molecule Cancer Drugs  
When the nitrogen mustard alkylating agent mechlorethamine reached the market in 1949 as the first anticancer drug, the worldwide life expectancy was 46.8 years (World Population Prospects The 2015 Revision, Kinch 2014). In 2015, when approximately 160 anticancer drugs were available for clinical use, the life expectancy reached 71.4 years (World Health Statistics 2017). However, an increase in the number of deaths associated with aging diseases, such as cancer, resulted from this demographic change (Ames et al. 1993). As a consequence, cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide today (World Health Statistics 2017). Therefore, the constant development of novel antineoplastic agents continues to be a foremost public health demand, despite the current availability of many anticancer drugs in the market.  
  
The development of the first cancer chemo – therapy dates back to the early 1940s when the anticancer activity of the nitrogen mustard-based war gas was discovered. Nitrogen mustards are DNA alkylating agents that interfere with DNA replication. Like the DNA alkylating agents, the most frequently used chemotherapy drugs have been identified empirically without pre-existing knowledge of the molecular mechanism of action. Despite the groundbreaking progress in the understanding of cancer, including the characterisation of cancer viruses of animals in the 1960s and 1970s, the discovery of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes in the 1970s and 1980s and the more recent mapping of signalling networks associated with the hallmarks of cancer, the treatment options for cancer haven’t changed much in past decades. Certain malignancies including testicular cancer, gestational choriocarcinoma, Hodgkin’s disease and high-grade lymphomas have shown to be highly sensitive to conventional chemotherapy. Optimisation and combination of conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy have produced higher cure rates for many cancers. By contrast, curative treatment remains elusive for the majority of patients with metastatic tumours. In the absence of a specific mechanistic understanding, particularly with regard to the molecular target, it is difficult to learn from the successes and failures and understand why different tumour types have different susceptibilities. However, the cancer-research community acquired a critical mass of significant knowledge that allowed for the transition of modern anticancer drug discovery from cytotoxic towards targeted therapies. Targeted therapeutic agents, including small molecules or monoclonal antibodies, interfere with a discreet molecular target in order to have desired therapeutic effects and have the potential to be personalized for each patient.

"usually yes, but in this case the cancers all shared a defect in their DNA repair mechanism. DNA is screwing up all the time and has to be constantly repaired. If that repair mechanism fails, the mutation rates go insanely high and normally the immune system just kills the cells if they don't die on their own. So in a sense this isn't normal cancer and it's the perfect target for a drug that tells the immune system to kill damaged cells even if those cells are pretending not to be damaged. I mean that's what cancer is - cells that ignore their usual program. Unfortunately most cancer isn't this obvious about it's ambition. And you can't just tell the immune system to start killing every cell in the body that's a little sus - every time you got a cold the immune system would like vaporize your entire upper respiratory tract.",cancer

That could have three explanations: 1) either this specific type of cancer is extremely rare which would make it not feasible to include more patients, or 2) the investigators expect the drug to work really really well which means that you do not need a lot of participants to show that the drug works, or 3) the drug works so extremely well that the authors stopped the trial early to publish their results, so that others can be treated with this drug.",cancer

Antibiotics are not a big money maker, not like drugs you have to take every day like statins for the rest of your life. Not much has changed in the ensuing years and we are still looking down the barrel of a gun - resistant strains of TB, the clap and, here in America, UTIs. Cipro, for example, is prescribed like candy for UTIs and yet carries the worst ding possible from the FDA, a black box warning, becasue of the horrendous, life threatening side effects people can experience which I know of first hand. It's no secret in the medical community and there is a hotline to the ambulance chasers. They only want to hear from families of people who have died, though. That's how many cases there are.

Anyway, no one wants the gov to get involved is directing development but I think there is a place for that.

As to this drug, absolutely it will out of reach for many people. Twenty five years from now or so  _ I'm retired and don't keep up much these days as to patent expirations - there will be affordable generics but that is a lot of dead people in between now and then.

Basically, the smaller your sample size the larger the studied effect has to be in order for it to hit the threshold that tips it over into statistically significant.  So as long as the effect is quite large (which seems to be the case here), you can still reach a statistically significant result even with a small sample size.

If you’re looking for an effect that you anticipate to be very small though, you definitely have to go with a much larger sample size.",cancer

"I have to get a colonoscopy every three months to remove dozens of aggressive pre cancerous polyps, the grow fast and big!!! This is extremely exciting!

 I have Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a rare, inherited condition caused by a defect in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Most people inherit the gene from a parent. But for 25 to 30 percent of people, the genetic mutation occurs spontaneously.

FAP causes extra tissue (polyps) to form in your large intestine (colon) and rectum. Polyps can also occur in the upper gastrointestinal tract, especially the upper part of your small intestine (duodenum). If untreated, the polyps in the colon and rectum are likely to become cancerous when you are in your 40s.

Most people with familial adenomatous polyposis eventually need surgery to remove the large intestine to prevent cancer. The polyps in the duodenum also can develop cancer, but they can usually be managed by careful monitoring and by removing polyps regularly.",cancer

If all tumors are tested for mutations, they will find the people who benefit and give them the exact right drug.

"Actually, I'm in agreement with that summary! I'm sorry - I was not that detailed in my explanation, and I'm not sure which part you think disagrees? Let me know so I can try to clarify!

 Currently the standard of care treatment for early stage rectal cancer (stage II or III which is what these folks have), is what we call total neoadjuvant therapy which is a combo of some order of chemotherapy and chemoradiation followed by surgery. It is very aggressive, because we treat early stage cancer patients with curative intent. This trial looked at dMMR (mismatch repair deficient) patients, and the goal was to treat with immunotherapy, which we have data in the metastatic setting but not in the neoadjuvant setting, and if they had a complete response, possibly leave out the other parts (specifically surgery; I do believe that they were still going to have them proceed with chemorads), with the hope that we will have similar or even better cure rates. Based off these results, I think that may be the case, but this is very early data.",cancer
The patients were deficient in DNA mismatch repair. Only around 10% of rectal cancers are dMMR but treatment with immunotherapy are usually effective in these cases. This immunotherapy is unusual effective and probably why it was published in the highest ranking medical journal.,cancer

It was a international clinical trial & she was somewhat disabled after the treatment (severe epilepsy due to scar tissue from the 13 brain surgeries) it was really quite intense 
but looking back the changes that happened in her life following the cancer may have significantly contributed to a lot of depression that might have made a full recovery back to normal life much more difficult than it would’ve been otherwise and I think if she had had more autonomy over the decisions that were made about her she might of had a normal life afterwards I think that when you’re sick and people infantilise you & you never get regain your autonomy it’s very difficult to regain your health so who knows what would’ve happened but she lived for 30+ years after the “you have 2 weeks maybe a month” diagnose I was born without any major issues",cancer

The US spends more per capita on healthcare than other countries with universal healthcare, and health results or care quality in the US aren't at all obviously better; it's worse on some metrics. People in other countries rate their satisfaction with healthcare much higher than people in the US. The US currently has a bureaucratic system with many faults--primarily the possibility of individuals to incur burdensome costs they may struggle to pay, which is bad for the individual, the healthcare provider, and the taxpayer.

I used to hear about wait times too as a talking point, but I was never able to find actual data behind that. Do you have a source that shows waiting times or quality of care?

&#x200B;

>And FYI, Canada has private insurance too.

You're correct that countries with universal healthcare also allow people to purchase supplemental private insurance. However, I believe the important issue is that in the US, individuals can experience gaps in coverage and burdensome costs. I think it would be better to protect individuals from burdensome healthcare costs by having some system of universal coverage. Healthcare is a unique type of cost compared to any other (housing, food, transportation, clothing) in that an individual can incur catastrophic costs at any time if they experience a terrible accident or develop a terrible disease. That's why universal coverage is generally better than a system without universal coverage in my opinion.",cancer

Scroll down [here](https://atotaxrates.info/individual-tax-rates-resident/tax-free-threshold/) to ""What Is Bracket Creep? How The Tax Brackets Work In Australia"" and you see our tax brackets.

&nbsp;

Anything covered by Medicare here, either goes to the provider, and you pay the remainder (~20%), or you pay the full amount, then claim it yourself, and get back ~80%.

Over a certain threshold ([see here](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/what-are-medicare-safety-nets-thresholds?context=60092)) and you get a higher % back.

&nbsp;

Our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme covers most medications for most circumstances (not all, but it covers ***a lot***), and for any medications and whatnot covered by it, you pay a fraction of their usual costs (as an example, for my ADHD meds, about $5-10AUD, vs ~$50AUD or more, *per month).

&nbsp;

Ambulance costs vary by state, with mine including a small levy when earning over a certain amount (over the initial tax threshold, I believe, and I think results in ~2% higher 'tax'  overall).

&nbsp;

Any hospital services at any public hospital, including surgery, as a public patient (not referred from private practices, essentially), you pay nothing.

This includes emergency visits.

Our private health insurance helps cover other costs, such as private hospital or other medical services, and procedures.

My own psychiatrist practices privately, and even that, I can claim on Medicare to get ~80% of the cost back.

&nbsp;

You're advocating for the worst healthcare system in the world, who puts money over patient care, with thousands if not millions dying every year, unnecessarily, including many women from preventable post-birth complications.

If you really think you'd rather be paying exorbitant out-of-pocket costs you, and ***many*** others can **not** afford, rather than ~20-40% of your annual income, you're delusional.

No system is perfect, but the USA's is the worst in the world.",cancer
"It was also my intent to show what the costs to a consumer could be under that comment's hypothetical scenario. Never did I say that a system of universal coverage would have no costs. Importantly, the US currently spends more per capita on healthcare than other countries with universal healthcare systems, and individuals in the US have to navigate a complicated, fragmented system which can have gaps in coverage and burdensome costs to individuals. I think it would be better to pay those costs through higher taxes instead and universal coverage with no gaps and no burdensome individual costs when a person needs medical treatment. I currently sink about $5,000 per year just in premiums (through my employer); imagine a system where there were no premiums and all those funds were freed up for other purposes. 

On another note, you mentioned Medicaid, but I recommend you look up the ""Medicaid gap"" if you're unfamiliar with it; it affects about two million people who are simply ineligible for any affordable coverage.

You can't just have access to experimental drugs just because you want them, you have to fit multiple requirements so scientific research can be done correctly, since thats is why they are offered.

"The US government already spends more on public health than many developed countries, you just get a lot less bang for your buck.

The Australian system allows for the existence of private healthcare for those who can afford it to avoid waitlists for non-critical services, but the public system is usually pretty good.

There are two real challenges for public healthcare in the US - the first is that there are a lot of vested interests in the current system, including doctors, insurance companies and employers. The second is that a more efficient healthcare system would have very significant impacts on the US economy - about 20 percent of GDP goes to healthcare compared to 10 percent in other developed countries. A ten percent cut in GDP would include millions of job losses for administrators, claims processors and so forth. In the long run they could be doing more efficient work but it would be an incredible disruption.

I also don't think there's much of a relationship between research and development and the healthcare model - governments fund most basic research and firms looking to develop new products are going to do so regardless of whether insurance companies in the US will pay $300,000 compared to other countries paying $150,000.

"No - I agree that a 100% success rate would appear to be above random chance *within the sample* - I'm just saying the sample is too small for the application of statistics to have any real meaning, i. e. with a sufficiently small N, we can't really say whether something is less likely to be random chance than a given value of *p*. We can get a **number** that is near zero, by all means, and we can say something should move on and receive further study, in a qualitative sort of way - which is perfectly valid.

This trial can be seen as a first step to test the hypothesis that the approach (PD1 targeting in MMR-deficient CRC in neoadjuvant settings) was sound. These results, as preliminary as they are, indicate it makes sense to conduct more trials including phase I-III (though phase I could *potentially* be skipped as phase I studies were already conducted with dostarlimab in other cancer types - I may be wrong here however, hence the potentially).",cancer

I've been on other that have gone below either because of a large expected response or low variability.  Some projects have no phase 2 at all... every project is different, but this doc is just giving an idea to lay people about what to expect.  If your expected effect size is high, which it probably was here, you can go below.  18 isn't even meaningfully below 20 in any statistical sense, and the 20 number is only approx because this is for lay people.

And finally again, the most important point which seems to woosh every Redditor:   Sample sizes are *apriori* estimates of what is needed for statistical significance before you do the study, if you have statistical significance then the sample size was large enough.  100% remission will be statistically significant",cancer

I believe, this is treating the later group with the dMMR type. 

Untreated, or for other reasons, people experiencing colo-rectal and find the desease moves and they get lung metastases, some develop liver metastases, and some get peritoneal metastases (me, again).

Agreed that the system can be difficult to navigate and the waiting time can be long. Wish it was better.

Meanwhile, for the OP and other readers: There are other places with no/low cost therapy and shorter waiting time, where we needn't bounce through different organizations for months. There's Care Corner Counselling Centre, Silver Ribbon, Calvary Community Care, Singapore Association for Mental Health, counselling and emergency helplines etc, just to name to few. Some sessions can be done in-person while some can be done through video calls too, which makes it more accessible and less daunting for some of us. 

There's also a difference between going for psychiatry appointments (where they focus on managing things through medication) vs psychology and counselling sessions (more like talk therapy without medication, in layman terms, and looking at how our thoughts, behaviors, and emotions interact and how we can better manage them, relationships and life events, and improve our mental health).

Hope this helps a little and feel free to comment here if more resources are needed! The system isn't perfect but we can pool resources together and help each other where we can. Take care OP and everyone. :)",other

Anti-depressants take time to work, it's not like taking a Panadol. It could take a few months and suicidal thoughts could be triggered during that period.

Private specialists and meds are expensive but find a good doctor who has rapport with you. My visits became maintenance visits, once every 3 months. Ask the doc to give you a longer prescription so you don't have to see them all the time. They can also send the prescription to a public hospital pharmacy, so you a lot less for it. 

Ask the doctor for generic versions of the meds - they cost a fraction of the brand name stuff.",other

"The price is one of the reasons why despite my diagnosis a few years ago, I refuse to get medications. I simply don't have the budget to pay for medicine. For me, I don't rely on friends because I don't think it is fair for them to have the knowledge of whatever I am going through. But this also makes me feel incredibly lonely because I have no one to share my troubles with, which is why I turn to reddit so I can rant in a place where no one knows me. It is great that you have the backbone to rely on yourself to move forward, and I hope you continue to do so.",other

"Ayyy gonna talk about my shite exp with IMH

So when applying for NS I had to see a psyche obviously
But they didn't really diagnose anything wrong with me(which is wrong, they didn't even know I had autism cause previously I saw doc and they concluded I don't have it)
So go NS
First week in 
Self harm
Got refer to A&E

Got 2 week mc and down pes(I was pes c)
At IMH they refer me to 2 doctor
One general doc and one autism specialist
But autism specialist wasn't available until August
So it became a game of me going to the general doctor and them saying we can't do anything about your condition and not giving me my meds 
And continue to suffer cause of it
Until one day I decided to jump from the 5th floor of my office
Got sent to A&E again
This time they only give me anxiety medicine but only for 1 week
And it's the kind wherre u must have an attack then take

Come August
The day before I see the specialist they call and cancel my appt cause novid
I raged and had enough 
I literally bought a knife and threaten to kill myself in front of them if they didn't give me medication 
Then bam suddenly even tho not specialist
Can give medicine
They then also quickly rebook the specialist for me. Cause suddenly got space 2 weeks ltr


So yea fck IMH
If it weren't for the fact we need medifund to pay for the doctor And meds and private doctors aren't covered under medifund
I would have switched by now",other

"I too went to IMH, somewhat similar troubles to you but i won't dive too deep into it

Agreed with all of the points you have talked about. Picked up japanese indie folk after my attempt and it was pretty much god's gift. Attended coding courses to prepare for my studies. Ultimately, anyone can throw any help in the world at me but if I not willing to receive it, **it will be useless**

The thing about IMH is like every other hospital, there are a lot of people and there will be priority given. Like for example, if you just tried to end your life with an attempt and you got stopped and brought to IMH A&E, you wouldn't wait for 3 hours or more. It is technically an emergency and it is quite scary. You see people coming in tied on all fours in beds wheeling into the wards, screaming to see their moms. For my case, I waited 4 hours. You can dm me if you need any help

I hope you are doing better now. For me, my mood generally is better than last time though a few days I will crumble.",other

"sharing some tips for those who happen to be working adults - don't be afraid to thoroughly check what your workplace insurance covers, especially since some workplaces aren't super upfront about this information. i went the polyclinic -> psychiatrist -> psychologist 5-mth route that OP talked about, got medication multiple times, but everything (both appts and medication) was 95% covered by my workplace insurance. i was also a little scared that this info would somehow get out at work (sorry, archaic mindset) but so far so good, the info has been managed securely.

tips about speeding up the process - for your psychiatrist and psychologist visits, subsidised rate waiting time can be 1-3 months. sometimes, they will call you and tell you they have an open slot on super short notice, i.e. tomorrow (when someone cancels). i took up their offer, this shortened my wait by 1.5mths - if your employer/school is supportive, can watch out for this or even let the imh admin know that you are open to it.

for those who are working and have limited MCs/annual leave, once your psychiatrist and psychologist visits are in full swing, you can request for same-day appointments, so you don't have to take 2 separate MCs/leave. 

like an earlier commenter mentioned, you can also request to scale down your psychiatrist visits and focus on your psychologist visits once you think your medications requirements have stabilised. 

what helped me the most was understanding that i couldn't just pinpoint a root cause of my anxiety and depression and get rid of it like a normal ailment, and that treatment was a gradual process. jiayous to all here (especially OP!), please take care!",other
"Hi! Hope life's faring better for you now :) I'm 16F and might be going to see a counselor soon because I have some mental issues and it's O levels this yr 😩

I agree with what you said about friends because I do have some but it's so hard to talk to them about it because I'm the more introverted type and so I don't know how to talk to them sometimes so I always feel left out (even though a few of them also go to therapy for other issues) 

Have you tried other forms of help? Like counselling or therapists outside of IMH? I know you did mention about therapists being expensive in your post",other
"I think it sounds more like you are going through the same problem as most of us do, but you have problems adjusting to reality, which is normal. It is like everyone sitting for national exams, not everyone can pass them.

So based on your experience we can do some reality check. 

1. Friends are not everything. Indeed for most of us, our circle of friends shrink as we get older. People get married, have family commitments, and friends are probably at the bottom of their priority list. I had problems with this but I have slowly come to terms with it as I get older. So to your question, the antidote is to grow old. 

2. Getting cheating or feeling betrayed by your friends. Again this is probably more common than you think. I was sabotaged by several people in the course of my life, from secondary school all the way to uni. I thought I was unlucky, but I noticed that my parents and loved ones also been through the same bullying/ betrayal phases before, but life still goes on from there.

So the antidote is to find a few role models or your really loved ones, talk to them about their experiences of getting bullied and betrayed, and you will be surprised.

3. All being said, you may still feel you are the most unlucky person, I would suggest you do some volunteer work. There are many other people living in the worst conditions in Singapore, getting trampled upon all day. The antidote is to find small positive points in life and practice gratitude.

For example, ""I am lucky to have survived till this day to fight another day for myself"",

Or ""I am lucky that I am living in a safe place with three basic meals"".

4. Finally try to hold a conversation with yourself as if you are talking to a stranger telling you the same thing as you are doing here. How would you comfort this third person? What are the self care steps you would take? Self care also means taking steps to heal yourself such as seeing a psychiatrist, proper medication when prescribed by doctors, and defending yourself when you are receiving end of injustice. 

Always do good things even when you perceive unfairness or injustice, because don't regret your bad actions when you grow old. 

That's all I hope to say. Good luck and take care. Widen your social circles because there are equally as many good as bad people in this world. You are probably on the wrong side and it takes a bit of effort to switch sides.",other

"If as a population we've cooperated in virtually every way possible (TT, masks, testing, WFH, distancing, vaccines and boosters), but they're tightening instead of loosening restrictions (it was only this year that they gated up hawker centers and frankly they seem more anal in terms of seat distancing recently), it bodes very badly for the future. I don't think this should be the new normal. It does seem that they want to settle for this, tbh.",covid
"What are the sentiments on the booster though? It isnt as compulsory as the first 2 shots but it is now being pushed by all media outlets. As someone who can soon take booster, quite unsure honestly.",covid
"###Living With Covid
If we as a society are serious about 'living with covid', then we have to accept that everyone will get infected sooner or later. If that is unacceptable, perhaps because we want to protect the elderly or immunocompromised, then we have to revert to a 'zero-covid' stance and its accompanying harsher restrictions. **there is no inbetween**  
&nbsp;  
###Herd Immunity
Herd immunity isnt possible with the available vaccines. The vaccines need to provide long lasting immunity **against infection**. Further reading: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00728-2  
 
An overlooked issue is that many other vaccines that we take, confer long lasting immunity. Initially covid vaccines were marketed to us in the same way. Then we learnt that for the first ~3 days, fully vaxxed pple are still infectious. Now we are being told that boosters are needed.  
&nbsp;  
###Poor Communication
We've all seen the hosehliao copypasta. Simply put, MMTF feels more like a political training ground than a public health taskforce. We sorely need decisive proactive leadership. At least be transparent in their thought process? Its amazing that once Omicron appeared, all our projections became ???? overnight. We are now in this weird Living with Delta but Zero Omicron stance.  
&nbsp;  
###Moving Goalposts
Actually this isnt anyone's fault, its simply the reality of the arms race against covid19. However, because of poor communication, it has become a legit source of frustration. We know so much more today about covid19, but MMTF's messaging is still simplistic or non-existent. Waiting for more data is a non-answer when the pandemic started 2 years ago and trends can be seen from wave to wave.

We are probably familiar with how the goalposts have been moving, so I'll focus on the current messaging - 'get your booster'.  As far as I know about the science, MMTF has already set itself up for frustration because boosters are temporary (source in the next section). In 6 months time, or when the Omicron specific booster is available, the vaxxed/booster % will reset to zero and we'll see the next goalpost shift - 'get your omicron booster'. Cue the groans and pandemic fatigue.    
&nbsp;  
###Current Boosters are Temporary
I am pro science, pro vaccinations. I got MM because I didnt see a point waiting an extra month for PP. As I said earlier, living with covid means that everyone will get infected sooner or later. Herd immunity isnt possible with the current vaccines. 

**Therefore, my bottom line is to prevent severe illness and not take up hospital capacity.**  
(*For context, I'm a healthy young adult and able to WFH*)  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
I see no point in getting a booster because:  
##### 1) I am willing to accept my current risk profile, which is lower than a boosted 40-69yo. [source](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showFullTableHTML?isHtml=true&tableId=tbl3&pii=S0140-6736%2821%2902249-2) - [full journal](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21\)02249-2\/fulltext)  
##### 2) Vaccine efficacy **against hospitalisation** remains stable even after 6 months. [source](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21\)02183-8/fulltext#seccestitle140) - Figure 2 Graph B  
##### 3) Vaccine efficacy **against infection** will subside in 6 months. [source](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21\)02183-8/fulltext#seccestitle140) - Figure 2 Graph A
The vaccine formulation is exactly the same, we'll be back at square one in 6 months!  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
To be clear, I am not anti booster. If you're in a high risk group due to age, frontliner, co-morbidities etc, yes you should get boosted. But I think its overkill to 'force' even the young and healthy to get boosted. **Our booster supply is better used to help increase the global vax rate.**
Should new science emerge or when an Omicron specific booster is available, I'll get it immediately.  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
Thanks for listening to my ted talk, kthxbye",covid
"The policies managed to piss off everyone.

The obedient pro vaccination group readily complied with everything and believed in the policies. Today, covid is still rampant, people are still dying and restrictions are still in place. After all that is done, there is still anxiety and a depressing undertone.

The hesitant or anti vaccination group saw their freedom gradually stripped away. Some were forced to comply or lose their jobs. 

The neutral group just wants life to return to normal. But goalposts are constantly shifting, rules are fluid and seemingly inconsistent. We saw double standards but the govt continues to ask us to trust them and comply. Full disclosure, i belong to this group.

Amazing job guys.",covid
"vaccines were initially touted as a way to regain some normality. everybody was hyped, do your part to get jabbed so that we can live a bit of life again.

but instead we faced goalpost shifting (never high enough vaxxed % in the govt's eyes). will restrictions ever ease? yes, but for WEF delegates first, and for tourists, and for employers to call people back to office. of course some singaporeans enjoy their VTLs, but think of it as a ""risk"" budget which has been allocated more for economy than for ppl to live life properly.

soon, we will need booster jabs just to hold on to fully vaxxed status, to retain what semblance of normalcy we do actually have. oh, and so that you can keep your jobs while employers force you to go back to office.

we all benefit individually from vaccine in terms of less severe disease if we do get covid, but where have the societal benefits from the vaccines gone to?",covid
"I was in a cab today and the uncle said he’d only take the booster if it is “required” (he said if he is restricted from malls/ restaurants/ hawkers then he’d take the 3rd dose). He was also talking about how he thinks deaths from the vaccine are under or not reported so you can get a sense of where his baseline feelings are anyway. My interpretation: Before, many people only got vaccinated because there was a carrot at the end. This time, there is no carrot nor stick - so you get people’s true feelings about it. To achieve/maintain high vaccination rates you either need to incentivise it, disincentivize not getting it, or better educate people on the reasons for getting it (which itself is insanely difficult due to the amount of disinformation available online).",covid
"Preface: I am not anti-vax, I believe we should get it to reduce the stress on healthcare workers, as well as protecting yourself from the worst effects of covid. 

My guess is that people are fed up with the inaction of mmtf in opening up. At first say get vaccination will prevent covid, then turns out it will only reduce symptoms. 

Then they said once we reach 80% we will have herd immunity and we can relax measures, didn't happen.

I'm guessing those people who were on the fence (don't forget that the vaccines were rolled out without the normal amount of trials and clearance due to the need for them) now are feeling cheated, and they feel we're all being used as Guinea pigs. Coupled with the news of alleged hesitancy by MOH to cover people for serious side effects, people are feeling it's not very useful.

All these things give anti-vaxxers (note a lot of them are not anti-vax per-se, but not keen on the covid-19 vax) more ammunition to argue against it.

Finally, from a psychological point of view, the government's heavy handed approach to restricting unvaccinated people in carrying out their daily lives will only push people to be further entrenched in their beliefs. Humans don't react well to being forced to do things against their will, and what the government is doing is not nudging. If it's meant to be, it's poorly executed, kind of like some people read the book on nudges and think they are experts.",covid
"I think people are tired of having the reopening carrot dangled in front of them each time the government want something done. To be honest, I think they should just stick with the facts of the pros of the vaccine in saving life or make it mandatory. Adding that ""this is a step towards a covid resilient nation"" is backfiring hard now because nobody is feeling like it's a step forward.",covid
"First, you have to remember who sets the rules in Singapore and how much these rules affect daily lives of everyone here.

Then you should remember how often in the past 2 years vaccines were advertised as the only way out of this mess. Naturally, people were optimistic and willing to do their part.

Then nothing happened. No ease of restrictions, no light at the end, no explanations, nothing. Govt quietly shifted goalposts and now 90+% vax rate is not enough. What is expected to be enough next is never clearly stated but somehow the focus is on boosters. Is there really any wonder the people feel tricked? It doesn't take much brain to predict this would decrease booster % in the future. Sadly, this govt has no understanding of what their lack of clarity or planning results in. They will just continue making surprised pikachu faces every time.

Anyway, I will take the booster, but for my own reasons, not their stupid KPIs.",covid
"Get trace together and we can open up

Get vaccinated and we can open up

But the problem is after all that we didn't open up much, so once the government says get booster, no one seems interested after getting burnt twice.",covid
"It makes no sense to get a booster until you’re forced to, since the fully vaccinated status will last x months since the booster date. I think it’s a sure thing we’ll be forced into the 4th shot in not too distant future.",covid
"doesnt really change whether i take or dont take. i agree with the camp that ppl such as myself only take the vax for the benefits - back when there was light at the end of the tunnel.

Now that there's none, there's honestly not much incentive to do so unless ur in a high risk category. I think most ppl in this camp at this point alrdy know that the gahmen is just gonna flip flop more rules anyway. Until we see some semblance of ACTUAL CONCRETE steps toward ""living with covid"" that can almost un-mistakenly be identified as the gahmen's commitment, ppl in this camp will likewise adopt a flip-flop attitude towards booster shots. 

not saying other countries gahmens are necessarily handling it btr but neither do i think our gahmen is handling it satisfactorily.",covid
"Not much sense to take the booster for the younger ones ie most of us, when still so many of the more vulnerable older group are unvaxxed and will take up most of the ICU beds again should cases spike again.

A vaccine mandate for the elderly is the real priority and this is still not happening. And I care because restrictions will go up when the healthcare system gets stressed again.",covid
"I agree. I see what you mean. But counter point, the voting system on FB is very similar to Reddit's (yes, face it, redditors) in that it highly encourages echo chambers and you're much more likely to see the same viewpoint.

But I'm getting more and more jaded and losing hope in the vaccines day by day. It's obvious they're moving goalposts and grasping at straws to support vaccination.

First it was, get vaccinated, become immune, stop covid.

Then, oh no, who said vaccination prevents covid? It only prevents complications!

For a few months. But don't worry! A booster will restore your immunity! (To complications) 

Did we mention the side effects?",covid
"I was a strong advocate that everyone should get vaxxed in the early days, believing the promises that once we are vaxxed that life could return to normal. 

Now, unless MMTF signs in blood that life goes back to normal and we open up, I'm very reluctant to take the booster jab. Full disclosure that I'm a young adult in relatively good health, so really, I'll take my chances at this point in time. No more worrying over a messed up period for 3mths thanks to the jab together with the fever and discomfort that came with it.",covid
"I think the initial understanding of many people was that if you went for vaccination, you won't get Covid. Later, they understood it as, you will still get Covid but won't fall as ill. However, because restrictions weren't lifted, some felt cheated.

That being said, I personally feel that the number of anti-vaxxers have dropped. Initially, many people didn't expect Covid to last so long, so they acted cool. Many have since gone ahead to jab, whatever misgivings.",covid
"MMTF has shown time and time again that they aren't willing to live with covid. They only want to live with covid with measures that pleases them e.g. Allowing WIO and closing a blind eye on business that forces employees to wio under the "" essential service"" reason 


So they can fuck themselves with the booster shots.",covid

"Hope we are not helping you do your homework and like others said, FB as the only source (?) will not be representative.

Regardless, there are couple of issues. First is equity vs rights. Second, hearing WHO, gov advocating boosters not even more than a year after we talked about double jabs probably make some people skeptical about whether these “experts” have a long term game plan. Finally, when is endemic living actually coming for SG? 2022? 2023? After the next GE?",covid
"I think the messaging has been a major letdown in this situation. I don't have the ideal solutions as a layperson, but I rely on the experts and communicators to do an effective job
1. Need to address the fear, risk and uncertainty of a ""new"" tech - very dire on the mRNA front. I think there is always a need to compare to the next best alternative (either catching covid or getting a ""traditional""  vaccine).
2. Losing expert authoratativeness - quite early on, whether to mask, herd immunity, and later what do we mean by an effective vaccine
3. The foreign workers situation - this unpleasant situation for the worker, which was extensively covered in the news and social media, turned out to create a sense of lull and ""it cannot happen to me, only the "" others"""" mood in the wider population
4. Moving the goalpost and the penalty spot - moving one target is bad enough, we move the spot where we kick the ball as well. No alignment between target and launch 
Anyway, these are captain hindsight and armchair rants. The authorities have done as much good towards the public health of SG during these trying times as well, and it is not that they are not trying to.",covid
"Best way to really measure how many people are ok or supportive of the booster shots, see how many people get their booster shots",covid
"I'm beginning to think the reason Gov didn't mandate is because of the rolling target of the vaccination status. They knew of the vaccination efficacy waning, back in April last year, before the vaccine rollout. Imagine if they mandated it, it would be a nightmare to manage people's vaccination status. That's why TT and VDS are still in place and will continue to stay in place for some time.

The main reason majority will take booster now is not for safety, but to avoid restrictions. Just look at the comments here.",covid
"Taking vaccine at such quick rate has a lower efficiency compared to having it yearly(you can google the study yourself). The only reason we allow it to be rushed is cause of the virus. Taking  1st and 2nd shot 1month apart is the shortest timeframe without huge increase in risk or fall in efficiency. Now that most of us are vaccinated, I wouldn’t be too interested in rushing for a booster that is based on the original COVID and is rushed to the public because of the pandemic. There is for SURE a better vaccine to be made since we have more data now.",covid
May I summon u/hosehliao to sum it up for you ?,covid
"i’m alright with the vaccination & have gotten both. Not so happy with getting children vaccinated since whatever is being said, this is still a trial run. I am more unhappy with stupid covid restrictions by authorities, companies, malls and buildings. We are learning new scientific facts about Covid but these restrictions have not caught up and seem arbitrary and idiotic.

Example:
- No recorded music can be played in food outlets
- public pianos cannot be played 
- being asked to use hand sanitizer to enter shops
- scanning tracetogether at the open beach (thankfully removed)
- having to add children to group scan even when they don’t even have an nric
- unvaccinated not allowed in malls & restaurants 
- family of 4 having to split up even when dining out 5 is fine cause food outlet does not have person checking them

We are just treating people in an arbitrary manner.. I think the Task Force needs to better interpret their restrictions..",covid
"Most people like vaccinations, got jabbed enthusiastically and moved on. For this group even the child vax stuff is less uneventful because it was signaled and well prepared for over the last couple months 

Now the people that are actively engaging with vax content tend to be the anti vax or other disgruntled parties.

Facebook is an echo chamber Simple as that",covid
"Duh, it's pretty obvious.
The whole vaccine thing was sold to the populace with the idea that if we take them, all these Pandemic bullshit (cases, measures) will end. Well look at now, what happened? The majority of the populace took it and our cases and measures got worse. We are further from opening up than before, with vaccines. And now we are told that we need boosters, it feels like it will never end. Of course the people would be unhappy.

Everyone I know who took the vaccines, took it not because they fear the virus, they took it because they fear the restrictions.",covid
"The vaccines were developed to protect the vulnerable group (old, weak, underlying medical conditions, etc) so it make perfect sense at the initial stages of the inoculation exercise. However, when we started to extent this to teenagers and children (without knowing the long term risk) in order to continue protecting the frail, it doesn't seem logical anymore.

Secondly, we are very slow in opening up, citing strain on the healthcare system, yet have VTLs with numerous countries and importing positive cases who may add unnecessary stress to it.",covid
"I think its srill prudent to be conservative because of the emergence of omicron. There were signs of reopening (vtl etc) but omicron came. Any major shift to reopen very hard to u turn again imo, there are cost to implementation shift i feel.

I think most imptly is we quickly get vaccinated/boosters.

The booster implementation also seemed to have hastened base on what i see.",covid

However as situation has developed. Alpha, beta, delta and now omicron emerged. People are just tired of the empty promise and the shifting of goal posts.  
  
Truthfully, as long as we don’t have to paid for it and there are no major side effects, the vaccines benefit outweight the risk of covid complications such as pneumonia. People just worried about what government is dicating them on what to do. But seriously speaking, I think we all should just trust the science.

Forgotten about human history? Then you're doomed to repeat it.  The only way you can protest is to not comply.

It's normal to be hesitant of taking up something that you can't clearly see a benefit with your own eyes. What's abnormal is the gov using all sorts of coercive methods to continue to push the same narrative despite failing miserably. Why the hell would you take a jab that can only reduce a symptom , not prevent transmission and you still need to take Nth boosters for each new variant?? This should not be labeled as a vaccine. What's more we're still experiencing more and more restrictions. If you haven't been questioning the authorities, it's high time you start calling them out!

Social science is fake science. And it has plagued our entire system from health to education. That's why we're seeing everything all these fragile systems crumble under its own weight.

"I think it's people's fear, uncertainty and doubt playing into the picture.

A lot of us are trying to figure out if the Omicron variant isn't, as they say, any more deadlier than the previous variants after being twice-shot vaccinated. News media are reporting conflicted pictures about the booster shots. Singapore, while declaring that their policies are not reactive in nature, naturally reacted like Mr. Kiasu & declare the booster shots as necessary (but not mandatory, their words).

In the meantime, social gathering restrictions are getting too restrictive for our happiness and sanity. I, for one, am looking for partners because I just had a birthday last week, and I qualified for resale HDB. Restrictions, even if it is technically more than 2 people, remained a psychological barrier for both myself and my family, who are socially averse to large crowds, and socialising as an activity.

So I guess, you could say that people want to return to massive groups of people gathering, and want clear guidelines that new travellers must be vaccinated against the Omicron variant, too, before coming in (""*law for thee but not for me, too""). People who get the Omicron variant—including Singapore Citizens and PRs—must stay isolated like the usual home quarantine procedures.

The question is whether the trade-off is worth it, i.e. the risks of adverse effects.

  
Throwing all the anti-vax arguments aside. Do note that the initial trials were mainly only for TWO doses of the same brand. Meaning they only have trial data on people who took two doses of the same brand. But now they are encouraging people to take booster shots, mixing brands. All of these are not tested in any trials at all. Everything is a big unknown and yet they are going to force people to do it soon. How is this science ?",covid
And singapore is one of the few countries opposing a patent waiver that can make it more available to the world and curb the spread of the virus and new variants.,covid
"That's 700,000+ people, not cases. So if we roughly multiply by 8 to match Singapore's population, that's the difference between 1256 severe cases without boosting vs 136 severe cases with boosting. And more than half of the people were only followed up for 14 days after the booster, so a fairly narrow time window for them to become infected.

I guess that's part of the negative sentiment towards the booster. The reduction in risk of severe Covid is from small to smaller for non-elderly, but it's more useful at a public health level to avoid crashing the hospital system. So it feels like a bit of a personal sacrifice to go through the jab side effects for the sake of society.",covid
"Here are some points you missed out.

1) you are assuming the incidence rate of severe disease in the entire population is the same as the elderly before and after the 3rd dose, which is incorrect.

Comparing table 2 and 3 shows the decrease in risk of severe disease for the elderly above 70 years old when getting a 3rd shot is very different from the general population.

2) yes the sample size is 728,321, but the time period of the study is very short. In the appendix it shows the number of person-days for the analysis at approximately 6.5 million. In other words about 9 days per subject.

Obviously you can’t properly extrapolate the same risk of infection to other time periods outside the study, it’s probably worse now with the Omicron variant, but even if we assume it’s the same a 0.02% chance of getting severe disease every 9 days isn’t great.

3) the definition of severe cases used was:

Individuals who have SpO2 <94% on room air at sea level, a ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) <300 mm Hg, respiratory frequency >30 breaths/min, or lung infiltrates >50%.
Critical Illness: Individuals who have respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction.

This is extremely bad and means the patient is probably going to die without ICU care. There can be patients who are also in a very bad shape but just not bad enough to qualify as severe disease, which the authors also noted in the conclusions.

4) The analysis was started 7 days after vaccination with the 3rd dose, which may not be long enough for immunity. Other papers use longer intervals a such as [this](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2114255) which uses 12 days (7 days for antibodies to build up, 5 days for delay of detection of infection). With the median follow-up time of 13 days it may skew the data to make the 3rd dose seem less effective than it really is.

If any scientists would like to discuss more about the paper you can join us on r/COVID19",covid
"From a purely selfish perspective, I think focusing on severe symptoms overlooks other highly unpleasant symptoms that are well worth avoiding or reducing the severity of. I haven’t had covid, but I have had bouts of flu that made me feel like I was going to die and/or wish I would, and they were nowhere near what counts as “severe”. If taking a couple of hours to get a booster helps me reduce the chance I get that kind of experience with covid, it’s worth it to me.",covid

It would be fair to say there is a loss in immunity or protection if there is a loss in antibodies too.",covid
"ah I didnt mean to add to your indecision 😂 frankly if a 3rd shot is needed to maintain vax status, I will also llst and get boosted. I do wish we had the option to donate our booster allocation to others, vaccine inequality is too real",covid
Well I agree with you on that,covid
I did say theoretically,covid
"Booster doesn’t protect you from testing positive for Covid. Neither does the vaccine.

Positive PCR test with no symptoms didn’t count as a case in vaccine efficacy studies",covid
"its already happening with Omicron, and test balloons about needing a 4th booster. Actually you put 2 and 2 tgt, if you want maximum protection, you're gonna need a booster every 6 months, and Pfizer will happily oblige you. All while the under privileged dont have access to their 1st shot =(",covid
Would make sense if they had lots of stock of the original vaccine.,covid
"ah I didnt know, got a source to share?",covid
"Well that’s the role of the b cells, they produce antibodies during an infection.",covid

"Eh, I know we’re all speaking from limited anecdotal evidence here, but I was down for like 1 day, so I don’t find it a big deal. Of course individual responses differ.",covid
"> frankly if a 3rd shot is needed to maintain vax status, I will also llst and get boosted.

Which is exactly why the government will implement it. Without the vax status push factor I think a good 20% total population or more will never go for their boosters.",covid
"Correct, but that isn't even remotely in question here.

Going back to the fitness analogy, a trained individual will still retain greater amounts of myonuclei that facilitates faster muscle protein synthesis should the individual be subjected to a training stimulus again. Or colloquially, muscle memory. But it would still be a stretch to suggest that a detrained individual has not lost fitness.",covid
"Sure it does reduce infections. 

But thats a pretty arbitrary benefit if youre <40

Infected so what? Not like you will go crazy over the flu",covid
"I think u/fortprinciple is concerned about the positive test result impacting travel plans despite being asymptomatic. 

In my opinion, being vaccinated and being physically well should be enough for travel, and of course other areas of domestic life. 

I also don’t believe being infected is a big deal. The sooner the better, and I loathe every single government in the world that is looking at testing in addition to vaccination for travelers. It should be just vaccination, (pre-event) testing only if you are not.",covid

"I will be happy when we have AGI then ASI as doctors. Then, as nanobots become more advanced and used, it will just be a matter of the AGI/ASI maintaining our heath with these tiny machines. I'm just so sick of the US healthcare system and arrogant doctors with god complexes that pull out a formula for everything and are, basically, idiots otherwise who can't think independently for themselves. We need personalized medicine. We need the healthcare system to be seriously disputed by technology.",other
what is the normal blood pressure?,other
"Good. I’m tired of dealing with doctors who tell me I’m fine because I’m young and fit.

I hope for a day when all we need humans for is to adjust our position in front of a machine, while an AI takes all that information and makes diagnoses and recommendations for treatment.",other
"no they arent lol. Doing anything without an MD is illegal and the Doctors associations have such influence in healthcare that it will stay that way long long after the tech to replace them is here.

Very cool! Will likely not get as much attention as it deserves because of the unfortunate timing with the GPT-4 release tho,other
"The American medical system is an atrocity, you have my empathy. It's honestly responsible on its own for a significant amount of suffering just from me, and trying to get a diagnosis from it is often harder than getting treated. Which is already awful.",other
Yes all based on statistics and numbers and little actual theory or diagnosis of an underlying cause or a problem.,other
Lol dude! But honestly vitamins are they way to go! Especially B Vitamins and Magnesium and Potassium!,other
"How long you think that protection is going to hold up after AI systems are measurably much better than doctors?  

Note one way to ""skill up"" such systems would be to have them run enormous robotic laboratories where they practice on cell cultures and human ""mockups"".  (These are essentially living humans bodies but usually representational, where every organ is present but in separate containers and interconnected by tubing, and the brain is extremely small, only there so you can measure neuron health and concentrations past the blood brain barrier, which is also present.)",other
Yeah but one day A.I could be so advanced that you could prompt A.I to crispr gene edit yourself out of a medical illness instead of seeking advice from a doctor,other
Oh i do not believe your guarantee. Unless we kill ourselves our entire civilization and the way we do things will change drastically within the next few decades.,other
You do know that there are surgical machines that are now being ran by AI programs right? Monitoring vital signs is another task that is already being done by AI. Your other examples are relatively easy to do.,other
"Shit I was ""treated"" by our medical system for insomnia and I went from being healthy to being damn near disabled because of the treatment they hastily prescribed me.

I don't think I'll ever be able to fully trust doctors again. They completely fucked my life up and I have pretty much no recourse against them or the pharma companies.",other
the medical school system is just rote memorizing. nothing more. most doctors are no better than google.,other
"I'm in the UK, perfectly fit and healthy 30 year old 6 years ago, then repeated misdiagnosis that lasted years after a head injury eventually gave me cancer, a severe mould illness and MS. Completely resonated with what you're saying, every area of my life obliterated because these overpaid egos can't do the bare minimum of the job they're being paid to do.

And now they tell me that the treatments I've found that really do help are ineffective. It's disgusting.",other
"Fuck sake. I don't know what your health issues are, but I'm going to list some things that have helped me and that I've been surprised have helped all sorts of things you wouldn't expect them to just incase there's anything in there that might help.

Understand I was completely sceptical about a lot of these and no doctor will ever tell you they are effective but I've seen with my own health and with other people with everything from cancer to schizophrenia to chronic pain that treatments that target your health at a fundamental level can have powerful effects downstream for many different conditions. 

Hyperbaric oxygen treatment
Low dose naltrexone.
High dose vitamin D
IV infusions NAD/Biotin/vitamin C/glutathione
Pemf (this is the only one I'm a believer in but haven't tried extensively)

The doctors I've spoken to reject anything that doesn't have extensive studies proving its effectiveness, but some of these treatments have been game changers for me. Life is still nothing like it should be but to give you one example the nurse I have IVs with is working with someone who was in a wheelchair before they began IVs and hbot and they now regularly go on hikes so I guess I just wanna say don't lose hope and I really hope there is something that can help with your movement disorder because I know how scary that kind of shit can be and currently I'm more positive than ever.",other
