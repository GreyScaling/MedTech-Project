       "      <td>ADMIN NOTE This topic is a general discussion of the principle of reinstatement. For case-by-case consideration of what YOU should do, please put your questions in an Introductions topic.\\n \\nDo not put those questions in this topic, because detailed discussion of YOUR particular circumstances will take it off track and make this topic difficult for others to follow. The moderators will move any questions about YOUR particular case to the Introductions forum. Thank you.\\n \\nAlso see\\n\\nStabilizing, what does that mean? How long does it take after reinstating or updosing?\\n\\nStabilizing after a reduction -- what does that mean?\\n  Don't suddenly go off a psychiatric drug assuming that reinstatement is a safety net\\n  This is one of the reasons we advocate gradual tapering to minimize withdrawal symptoms. Once the nervous system is destabilized by withdrawal, all bets are off. Humpty Dumpty the egg has fallen off the wall.\\n  What is reinstatement?\\nReinstatement means resuming the drug or its equivalent when withdrawal symptoms appear.\\n  According to what medicine knows about psychiatric drug withdrawal syndrome, reinstatement is the only way to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. All the papers about withdrawal symptoms allude to how symptoms usually resolve after reinstatement. This is considered a hallmark of withdrawal syndrome.\\n  Some papers recommend resuming a partial dose of the drug rather than a full dose. See below for discussion.\\n\\nThe inserts in all the newer antidepressants and many other psychiatric drugs advise reinstatement if withdrawal symptoms appear. This is all medicine knows about how to treat withdrawal.\\n  Unforturnately, we have seen reinstatement does not always work. Tapering carefully to avoid withdrawal symptoms is a much safer approach. Medicine wants to believe withdrawal lasts only a few weeks, but evidence is emerging that's only the acute phase -- post-acute withdrawal syndrome can last many months.\\n\\nWhat we have learned about reinstatement\\nFrom what we've learned from patient experience here and other online support sites:\\nReinstatement is best done immediately upon appearance of withdrawal symptoms. The more time that passes, the less likely it is to work.\\nThe length of this window of opportunity is unknown, it varies according to the individual. Sometimes people can reinstate successfully months or years after quitting. Others cannot.\\nOften a very low dose will relieve withdrawal symptoms. If, for example, you were taking 20mg Paxil and quit rapidly or cold-turkeyed only a few days ago, 5mg may be enough. After trying the lower dose for a week, you can always increase if you feel you need more. If you've been off the drug longer, your nervous system may be sensitized and it may be wiser to try a sample dose, such as 0.5mg-1mg, to see how you react.\\nAvoid kindling, start low to see what you need. You can always increase if necessary. If you've been off the drug for a month or more, many people can find some relief from withdrawal symptoms by reinstating as little as 0.5mg-1mg for 20mg citalopram, for example. Do not start at a high dose, your nervous system may be sensitized by withdrawal and you may your symptoms much worse, which is called kindling -- see a fuller explanation below.\\nYou may be able to reinstate an equivalent drug. Some drugs are siblings, such as citalopram and escilatopram or venlafaxine and deslavenfaxine. Fluoxetine, which is arguably easier to taper than other SSRIs, may be substituted for SSRIs such as paroxetine or sertraline. (If you have had a prior adverse reaction to a drug, it may not be advisable as a substitute.)\\nCold turkey is not a shortcut to a lower dose\\n  Additional reasons to reinstate only a low dose\\nReinstating at a low dose reduces the risk of severe adverse reactions, such as kindling.\\nExperiencing withdrawal may have sensitized you to drugs and a larger dose may cause an outsized adverse reaction.\\nIf you had adverse effects while you were taking the drug, a low dose may not trigger the adverse effects but still reduce withdrawal symptoms. Adverse effects tend to be dosage-related: The higher the dose, the worse the reaction.\\nThese drugs are vastly more powerful than they need to be; often reinstatement at half dosage is sufficient and many people do well with a lot less. You want to take the lowest dose EFFECTIVE to reduce withdrawal symptoms.\\nYour receptors may have adjusted somewhat (upregulated) during the time you were tapering or had withdrawal symptoms and don't need as much drug to return to their prior homeostasis. See Shapiro, 2018. Subtherapeutic doses of SSRI antidepressants demonstrate considerable serotonin transporter occupancy: implications for tapering SSRIs\\nIf you can stabilize on a lower dose, you have less to taper when you finally do go off.\\nYou can always adjust the dosage upward if you find you need to. After reinstatement, most drugs take about a week to reach full effect. Wait until you see the full effect before you make an increase -- and then make only very gradual increases.\\n  How long should you give reinstatement?\\nUnless you have an immediate bad reaction, observe your symptom pattern for about a week to see if the reinstatement is helping. It takes about that long for your body to fully register the addition of most short half-life neuroactive drugs. If you have an immediate bad reaction, reduce or stop taking the drug.\\nAfter reinstatement, stabilizing on the drug varies according to the individual. Relief can be felt immediately, after some weeks, or after some months.\\nA slight immediate improvement is a good sign, this probably will progress as the drug ramps up to steady-state over a week. Improvement often occurs in The Windows and Waves Pattern of Stabilization\\nMore is not better! Your system has gotten a shock and may react badly to \"normal\" amounts of drug. Reinstatement may not immediately eliminate all withdrawal symptoms. It takes time to stabilize, you may still experience waves of symptoms, which usually lessen as time goes on. Give your nervous system time to settle down, be patient after you reinstate, do not leap to increase the dosage.\\nThink in terms of months before you attempt to taper again. Once you feel withdrawal symptoms are reduced after reinstatement, give your nervous system time to stabilize before attempting dosage reduction. Do not attempt to taper again until you feel symptom-free, or at least until your withdrawal symptoms are mild, predicatable, and tolerable.\\n  When to discontinue reinstatement\\nIf, upon reinstatement, you very soon feel significantly worse, most likely you are sensitized to the drug and need to take a smaller dosage or, possibly, none at all. You will need to track your daily symptom pattern to see if it's the drug causing your symptoms. If so, they generally will be worse shortly after you take the drug.\\nSometimes reinstatement does not work. The nervous system has taken such a hard hit from withdrawal, it's destabilized beyond whatever effect the drug might have had.\\nYou get an adverse reaction from the drug. Look up your drug at drugs.com to identify known adverse reactions. A rash is always a bad sign. Sometimes an adverse reaction can be eliminated by taking a lower dosage. Do not mistake an adverse reaction for your existing withdrawal symptoms!\\nIf you have an immediate severe bad reaction, reduce or stop taking the drug\\n  Reinstate at what dosage?\\nSometimes reinstatement not only doesn't work but makes symptoms worse -- this is called kindling. That is why we often suggest very, very low doses -- to reduce this risk. Higher doses can go wrong in much bigger ways. A very low dose is a way to explore the option of reinstatement with less risk.\\n \\nDosage of reinstatement is always going to be a guess. Here are some factors contributing to the decision:\\nHow long you've been off the drug. If you've just cold-turkeyed 20mg Celexa a few days ago, you might reinstate closer to your original dosage, such as 10mg. (It may not be necessary to go back to 20mg, standard dosages tend to be overly powerful.) Cold turkey is not a shortcut to a lower dose. Reinstatement might not work at all, and you're stuck in severe withdrawal.\\nIf your system has been sensitized by going on and off drugs. If you've had withdrawal symptoms for weeks, your nervous system might have become hypersensitive from destabilization. For example, if you had been taking 20mg Celexa, you might wish to try reinstating at a lower dosage, such as 0.5mg-1mg. It may seem incredible, but these tiny doses are often sufficient to reduce withdrawal symptoms. You can always increase later.\\nIf you have symptoms of hyper-reactivity or alerting (anxiety, panic, sleeplessness), you may be too sensitive for reinstatement. If you want to try it anyway, you might wish to try reinstating at a very low dosage, such as 0.5m-1mg if you had been taking 20mg Celexa, for example.\\nHow long you've been off the drug. If you've been off the drug for many months, reinstatement is less likely to work. If you want to try it anyway, you might wish to try reinstating at a very low dosage, such as 0.5mg if you had been taking 20mg Celexa, for example, or other SSRIs with a standard dosage of 20mg.\\nOther drugs you're taking. Be very careful adding a drug to other drugs. Use the Drug Interactions Checker before even considering this. (Your symptoms may be due to drug-drug interactions.)\\n  None of the above are hard-and-fast rules. There are reports of people with prolonged post-withdrawal syndrome who did better taking a drug at full dosage 2 years later. If you want to do this, please consult a doctor, we cannot advise you on it, the doctor is going to have to monitor your reaction to the drug.\\n  How about substituting another drug for reinstatement? (Especially for paroxetine)\\nIt is preferable to reinstate the drug that caused the withdrawal symptoms rather than another drug, the same drug is more likely to stop the symptoms.\\n  But In some situations, you may want to substitute another drug. For example, paroxetine (Paxil) stands out as being difficult to taper. It is so difficult, that if you went off paroxetine and you want to try reinstatement, we suggest substituting a very low dose of another drug, such as fluoxetine or citalopram. Fluoxetine and citalopram are most often used as substitutes; fluoxetine has a long half-life, which may make tapering easier, while citalopram's half-life is longer than the other SSRIs.\\n  Milligram for milligram, escilatopram is several times stronger than its sibling citalopram. If you've gone off escitalopram and always felt it was too strong for you, you may wish to reinstate with citalopram instead, or fluoxetine.\\n  We always urge attempting reinstatement of a very low dose initially, such as 1mg-2mg, to limit adverse reactions, in case the new drug doesn't agree with you. All the SSRIs come in prescription liquid form for easy titration.\\n\\nAbout benzo reinstatement\\nhttp://www.benzosupport.org/notes_on_reinstatement.htm\\n    ADMIN NOTE:  Useful Excerpts from the thread\\n  NZ11 in post 74:  https://www.survivingantidepressants.org/topic/7562-about-reinstating-and-stabilizing-to-reduce-withdrawal-symptoms/?tab=comments#comment-120338\\n  Alto in post 75, additional explanation:  http://survivingantidepressants.org/topic/7562-about-reinstating-and-stabilizing-to-reduce-withdrawal-symptoms/?do=findComment&amp;comment=120438\\n  Alto on Hypersensitivity:  Reinstatement is more likely to work if done fairly soon after stopping a drug, while the nervous system is still somewhat shaped around the drug that's been removed. The window of opportunity is not definitely a month, and probably varies from individual to individual, but reinstatement is best done sooner rather than later. \\n  This makes waiting to see if withdrawal symptoms will go away a difficult choice. If you wait, they may go away or you may miss your chance for effective reinstatement. (Medicine assumes withdrawal symptoms last only a few weeks; it's a sign you're in for a longer period of recovery if your symptoms have not diminished over this amount of time.) \\n  A while after discontinuation, the nervous system changes and may no longer accept reinstatement of the drug to repair the withdrawal reaction. It's like a series of dominoes gradually falling over time. Hypersensitivity can set in making reinstatement very difficult, as the nervous system will react in strange ways to the original drug and often other drugs as well. \\n  (A combination of Celexa with trazodone and nortriptyline can result in serotonin syndrome in anyone. If one's nervous system has been sensitized by withdrawal syndrome, this can cause disastrous adverse effects.) \\n  This is why when someone has been off the drug for more than a month, we suggest trying a very low dose. Hypersensitization is so common with withdrawal syndrome, trying a very low dose initially reduces the risk of a severe adverse reaction. And quite frequently, a very low dose will work to reduce withdrawal symptoms.\\n  Edited October 1, 2021 by Altostrata\\nupdated</td>\n",

       "0  ADMIN NOTE This topic is a general discussion of the principle of reinstatement. For case-by-case consideration of what YOU should do, please put your questions in an Introductions topic.\\n \\nDo not put those questions in this topic, because detailed discussion of YOUR particular circumstances will take it off track and make this topic difficult for others to follow. The moderators will move any questions about YOUR particular case to the Introductions forum. Thank you.\\n \\nAlso see\\n\\nStabilizing, what does that mean? How long does it take after reinstating or updosing?\\n\\nStabilizing after a reduction -- what does that mean?\\n  Don't suddenly go off a psychiatric drug assuming that reinstatement is a safety net\\n  This is one of the reasons we advocate gradual tapering to minimize withdrawal symptoms. Once the nervous system is destabilized by withdrawal, all bets are off. Humpty Dumpty the egg has fallen off the wall.\\n  What is reinstatement?\\nReinstatement means resuming the drug or its equivalent when withdrawal symptoms appear.\\n  According to what medicine knows about psychiatric drug withdrawal syndrome, reinstatement is the only way to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. All the papers about withdrawal symptoms allude to how symptoms usually resolve after reinstatement. This is considered a hallmark of withdrawal syndrome.\\n  Some papers recommend resuming a partial dose of the drug rather than a full dose. See below for discussion.\\n\\nThe inserts in all the newer antidepressants and many other psychiatric drugs advise reinstatement if withdrawal symptoms appear. This is all medicine knows about how to treat withdrawal.\\n  Unforturnately, we have seen reinstatement does not always work. Tapering carefully to avoid withdrawal symptoms is a much safer approach. Medicine wants to believe withdrawal lasts only a few weeks, but evidence is emerging that's only the acute phase -- post-acute withdrawal syndrome can last many months.\\n\\nWhat we have learned about reinstatement\\nFrom what we've learned from patient experience here and other online support sites:\\nReinstatement is best done immediately upon appearance of withdrawal symptoms. The more time that passes, the less likely it is to work.\\nThe length of this window of opportunity is unknown, it varies according to the individual. Sometimes people can reinstate successfully months or years after quitting. Others cannot.\\nOften a very low dose will relieve withdrawal symptoms. If, for example, you were taking 20mg Paxil and quit rapidly or cold-turkeyed only a few days ago, 5mg may be enough. After trying the lower dose for a week, you can always increase if you feel you need more. If you've been off the drug longer, your nervous system may be sensitized and it may be wiser to try a sample dose, such as 0.5mg-1mg, to see how you react.\\nAvoid kindling, start low to see what you need. You can always increase if necessary. If you've been off the drug for a month or more, many people can find some relief from withdrawal symptoms by reinstating as little as 0.5mg-1mg for 20mg citalopram, for example. Do not start at a high dose, your nervous system may be sensitized by withdrawal and you may your symptoms much worse, which is called kindling -- see a fuller explanation below.\\nYou may be able to reinstate an equivalent drug. Some drugs are siblings, such as citalopram and escilatopram or venlafaxine and deslavenfaxine. Fluoxetine, which is arguably easier to taper than other SSRIs, may be substituted for SSRIs such as paroxetine or sertraline. (If you have had a prior adverse reaction to a drug, it may not be advisable as a substitute.)\\nCold turkey is not a shortcut to a lower dose\\n  Additional reasons to reinstate only a low dose\\nReinstating at a low dose reduces the risk of severe adverse reactions, such as kindling.\\nExperiencing withdrawal may have sensitized you to drugs and a larger dose may cause an outsized adverse reaction.\\nIf you had adverse effects while you were taking the drug, a low dose may not trigger the adverse effects but still reduce withdrawal symptoms. Adverse effects tend to be dosage-related: The higher the dose, the worse the reaction.\\nThese drugs are vastly more powerful than they need to be; often reinstatement at half dosage is sufficient and many people do well with a lot less. You want to take the lowest dose EFFECTIVE to reduce withdrawal symptoms.\\nYour receptors may have adjusted somewhat (upregulated) during the time you were tapering or had withdrawal symptoms and don't need as much drug to return to their prior homeostasis. See Shapiro, 2018. Subtherapeutic doses of SSRI antidepressants demonstrate considerable serotonin transporter occupancy: implications for tapering SSRIs\\nIf you can stabilize on a lower dose, you have less to taper when you finally do go off.\\nYou can always adjust the dosage upward if you find you need to. After reinstatement, most drugs take about a week to reach full effect. Wait until you see the full effect before you make an increase -- and then make only very gradual increases.\\n  How long should you give reinstatement?\\nUnless you have an immediate bad reaction, observe your symptom pattern for about a week to see if the reinstatement is helping. It takes about that long for your body to fully register the addition of most short half-life neuroactive drugs. If you have an immediate bad reaction, reduce or stop taking the drug.\\nAfter reinstatement, stabilizing on the drug varies according to the individual. Relief can be felt immediately, after some weeks, or after some months.\\nA slight immediate improvement is a good sign, this probably will progress as the drug ramps up to steady-state over a week. Improvement often occurs in The Windows and Waves Pattern of Stabilization\\nMore is not better! Your system has gotten a shock and may react badly to \"normal\" amounts of drug. Reinstatement may not immediately eliminate all withdrawal symptoms. It takes time to stabilize, you may still experience waves of symptoms, which usually lessen as time goes on. Give your nervous system time to settle down, be patient after you reinstate, do not leap to increase the dosage.\\nThink in terms of months before you attempt to taper again. Once you feel withdrawal symptoms are reduced after reinstatement, give your nervous system time to stabilize before attempting dosage reduction. Do not attempt to taper again until you feel symptom-free, or at least until your withdrawal symptoms are mild, predicatable, and tolerable.\\n  When to discontinue reinstatement\\nIf, upon reinstatement, you very soon feel significantly worse, most likely you are sensitized to the drug and need to take a smaller dosage or, possibly, none at all. You will need to track your daily symptom pattern to see if it's the drug causing your symptoms. If so, they generally will be worse shortly after you take the drug.\\nSometimes reinstatement does not work. The nervous system has taken such a hard hit from withdrawal, it's destabilized beyond whatever effect the drug might have had.\\nYou get an adverse reaction from the drug. Look up your drug at drugs.com to identify known adverse reactions. A rash is always a bad sign. Sometimes an adverse reaction can be eliminated by taking a lower dosage. Do not mistake an adverse reaction for your existing withdrawal symptoms!\\nIf you have an immediate severe bad reaction, reduce or stop taking the drug\\n  Reinstate at what dosage?\\nSometimes reinstatement not only doesn't work but makes symptoms worse -- this is called kindling. That is why we often suggest very, very low doses -- to reduce this risk. Higher doses can go wrong in much bigger ways. A very low dose is a way to explore the option of reinstatement with less risk.\\n \\nDosage of reinstatement is always going to be a guess. Here are some factors contributing to the decision:\\nHow long you've been off the drug. If you've just cold-turkeyed 20mg Celexa a few days ago, you might reinstate closer to your original dosage, such as 10mg. (It may not be necessary to go back to 20mg, standard dosages tend to be overly powerful.) Cold turkey is not a shortcut to a lower dose. Reinstatement might not work at all, and you're stuck in severe withdrawal.\\nIf your system has been sensitized by going on and off drugs. If you've had withdrawal symptoms for weeks, your nervous system might have become hypersensitive from destabilization. For example, if you had been taking 20mg Celexa, you might wish to try reinstating at a lower dosage, such as 0.5mg-1mg. It may seem incredible, but these tiny doses are often sufficient to reduce withdrawal symptoms. You can always increase later.\\nIf you have symptoms of hyper-reactivity or alerting (anxiety, panic, sleeplessness), you may be too sensitive for reinstatement. If you want to try it anyway, you might wish to try reinstating at a very low dosage, such as 0.5m-1mg if you had been taking 20mg Celexa, for example.\\nHow long you've been off the drug. If you've been off the drug for many months, reinstatement is less likely to work. If you want to try it anyway, you might wish to try reinstating at a very low dosage, such as 0.5mg if you had been taking 20mg Celexa, for example, or other SSRIs with a standard dosage of 20mg.\\nOther drugs you're taking. Be very careful adding a drug to other drugs. Use the Drug Interactions Checker before even considering this. (Your symptoms may be due to drug-drug interactions.)\\n  None of the above are hard-and-fast rules. There are reports of people with prolonged post-withdrawal syndrome who did better taking a drug at full dosage 2 years later. If you want to do this, please consult a doctor, we cannot advise you on it, the doctor is going to have to monitor your reaction to the drug.\\n  How about substituting another drug for reinstatement? (Especially for paroxetine)\\nIt is preferable to reinstate the drug that caused the withdrawal symptoms rather than another drug, the same drug is more likely to stop the symptoms.\\n  But In some situations, you may want to substitute another drug. For example, paroxetine (Paxil) stands out as being difficult to taper. It is so difficult, that if you went off paroxetine and you want to try reinstatement, we suggest substituting a very low dose of another drug, such as fluoxetine or citalopram. Fluoxetine and citalopram are most often used as substitutes; fluoxetine has a long half-life, which may make tapering easier, while citalopram's half-life is longer than the other SSRIs.\\n  Milligram for milligram, escilatopram is several times stronger than its sibling citalopram. If you've gone off escitalopram and always felt it was too strong for you, you may wish to reinstate with citalopram instead, or fluoxetine.\\n  We always urge attempting reinstatement of a very low dose initially, such as 1mg-2mg, to limit adverse reactions, in case the new drug doesn't agree with you. All the SSRIs come in prescription liquid form for easy titration.\\n\\nAbout benzo reinstatement\\nhttp://www.benzosupport.org/notes_on_reinstatement.htm\\n    ADMIN NOTE:  Useful Excerpts from the thread\\n  NZ11 in post 74:  https://www.survivingantidepressants.org/topic/7562-about-reinstating-and-stabilizing-to-reduce-withdrawal-symptoms/?tab=comments#comment-120338\\n  Alto in post 75, additional explanation:  http://survivingantidepressants.org/topic/7562-about-reinstating-and-stabilizing-to-reduce-withdrawal-symptoms/?do=findComment&comment=120438\\n  Alto on Hypersensitivity:  Reinstatement is more likely to work if done fairly soon after stopping a drug, while the nervous system is still somewhat shaped around the drug that's been removed. The window of opportunity is not definitely a month, and probably varies from individual to individual, but reinstatement is best done sooner rather than later. \\n  This makes waiting to see if withdrawal symptoms will go away a difficult choice. If you wait, they may go away or you may miss your chance for effective reinstatement. (Medicine assumes withdrawal symptoms last only a few weeks; it's a sign you're in for a longer period of recovery if your symptoms have not diminished over this amount of time.) \\n  A while after discontinuation, the nervous system changes and may no longer accept reinstatement of the drug to repair the withdrawal reaction. It's like a series of dominoes gradually falling over time. Hypersensitivity can set in making reinstatement very difficult, as the nervous system will react in strange ways to the original drug and often other drugs as well. \\n  (A combination of Celexa with trazodone and nortriptyline can result in serotonin syndrome in anyone. If one's nervous system has been sensitized by withdrawal syndrome, this can cause disastrous adverse effects.) \\n  This is why when someone has been off the drug for more than a month, we suggest trying a very low dose. Hypersensitization is so common with withdrawal syndrome, trying a very low dose initially reduces the risk of a severe adverse reaction. And quite frequently, a very low dose will work to reduce withdrawal symptoms.\\n  Edited October 1, 2021 by Altostrata\\nupdated  \n",
       "1  So I just read the post on stabilizing...\\n  \"Most people are stable on psychotropic medications before their first taper, so there are no withdrawal symptoms. Holding helps to stabilize withdrawal symptoms that are acquired while tapering, going off CT, etc.\"\\n  My issue is that I haven't been stable like this for three years. The meds have stopped working and I believe I have been in some kind of withdrawal while still on meds. This the whole notion of tapering didnt make any real sense to me.

       "2  Sorry for the confusion, cmusic's question was answered in his topic http://survivingantidepressants.org/index.php?/topic/3677-cmusic-a-long-history-and-finally-saying-enough/page__p__42103#entry42103\\n    On 2/20/2013 at 10:05 AM, 'Altostrata' said:\\nIf your symptoms have gotten worse, that's a sign the Prozac was doing something. A higher dose might have made you worse, but a very low dose might help the withdrawal symptoms.\\n  Low-dose reinstatement may reduce the withdrawal symptoms experienced after quitting. These would be new symptoms different from the adverse effects of the drug while you were taking a full dose.\\n  \"Stabilizing\" as we use it means reducing withdrawal symptoms. It doesn't mean resolving whatever problems you might have had before going on the drug, or returning you to a perfect state of mind or body. Sometimes reinstatement works only slightly -- at least that's better dealing with the full force of withdrawal symptoms.\\n  And, unfortunately, sometimes it does not help at all.

       "3  My little experience: Jumped off Zyprexa 12/29/12 after a few months taper (don't remember the start...no idea it would matter). Mostly was on Zyprexa 5mg, jumped off at about 0.6 mg. tried a dose of 0.2mg 4/713. Slept too much, missed a work deadline, totally sedated, screaming at my husband (I know those 2 shouldn't go together). And the nausea that I was trying to stop re-emerged at 11 a.m. But otherwise it went well .

       "      <td>So, I really never suffered from depression. I did suffer from anxiety. I had been taking around 1 mg of Xanax for approx 4 or 5 yrs. Due to life circumstances, I made a huge mistake. I was feeling overwhelmed and went to a psychiatrist for the first time in my life. I went on Lexapro, most of the time at 30mg for 2 yrs. I then lost my job. She added 2mg of Abilify for the last 8 mos. of those 2 yrs on Lexapro. Time passed and my life got better. I don’t believe the Lexapro or Abilify helped me in the least. I CT’d off the Lexapro and Abilify at the same time. After about a month, I went into a hell that is indescribable. I suffered for 5 mos and am amazed I am alive.\\n  I tried reinstating Lexapro using the liquid. It was a disaster. Someone on the forum gave me advice to stay away from the liquid. The person saved my life. The liquid was much too strong. I then got tablets. I  split a 5mg tablet into quarters. I started taking 1.25mg. I stayed on that for a month. Very, very Slight improvement. I then took 2.5mg. Stayed at that for 4-6 weeks. Then 5 mg, 7.5, 10mg, 12.5, and finally 15mg. I stayed at each increase for 4-6 weeks hoping I could stop. 15mg is when the intense dread and fear subsided. Although there had been improvements along the way. At most every increase, I had a couple of days of awful adrenaline surges. It was rough. I was taking 1mg of Klonopin per day at the time. \\n  I am now tapering the Klonopin. I am down to .475mg per day. I haven’t returned to work. But I am alive. I am there for my children and husband. I feel that I am severely traumatized from what happened. \\n  I think many people would benefit from reinstating with a portion of a tablet rather than liquid.  I would love to get off of the Lexapro someday if I can gather the courage and the strength to try. My heart goes out to anyone dealing with this. I was seriously planning to end my life, the suffering was so intense. No where near anything I had ever experienced in my entire life. \\n  Edited April 10, 2018 by ChessieCat\\nadded spacing</td>\n",

       "79  I had several responses to my signature. I am very concerned about my well being. I am not feeling well and from your response I tapered too quickly. I want to work with my Dr. and be sure that I am doing the right thing. I added the 20 mg Prozac because I have nothing else and need to hear back from Psychiatrist. I tried to summarize my sign.

       "81  So, I really never suffered from depression. I did suffer from anxiety. I had been taking around 1 mg of Xanax for approx 4 or 5 yrs. Due to life circumstances, I made a huge mistake. I was feeling overwhelmed and went to a psychiatrist for the first time in my life. I went on Lexapro, most of the time at 30mg for 2 yrs. I then lost my job. She added 2mg of Abilify for the last 8 mos. of those 2 yrs on Lexapro. Time passed and my life got better. I don’t believe the Lexapro or Abilify helped me in the least. I CT’d off the Lexapro and Abilify at the same time. After about a month, I went into a hell that is indescribable. I suffered for 5 mos and am amazed I am alive.\\n  I tried reinstating Lexapro using the liquid. It was a disaster. Someone on the forum gave me advice to stay away from the liquid. The person saved my life. The liquid was much too strong. I then got tablets. I  split a 5mg tablet into quarters. I started taking 1.25mg. I stayed on that for a month. Very, very Slight improvement. I then took 2.5mg. Stayed at that for 4-6 weeks. Then 5 mg, 7.5, 10mg, 12.5, and finally 15mg. I stayed at each increase for 4-6 weeks hoping I could stop. 15mg is when the intense dread and fear subsided. Although there had been improvements along the way. At most every increase, I had a couple of days of awful adrenaline surges. It was rough. I was taking 1mg of Klonopin per day at the time. \\n  I am now tapering the Klonopin. I am down to .475mg per day. I haven’t returned to work. But I am alive. I am there for my children and husband. I feel that I am severely traumatized from what happened. \\n  I think many people would benefit from reinstating with a portion of a tablet rather than liquid.  I would love to get off of the Lexapro someday if I can gather the courage and the strength to try. My heart goes out to anyone dealing with this. I was seriously planning to end my life, the suffering was so intense. No where near anything I had ever experienced in my entire life. \\n  Edited April 10, 2018 by ChessieCat\\nadded spacing   \n",

       "      <td>So, I really never suffered from depression. I did suffer from anxiety. I had been taking around 1 mg of Xanax for approx 4 or 5 yrs. Due to life circumstances, I made a huge mistake. I was feeling overwhelmed and went to a psychiatrist for the first time in my life. I went on Lexapro, most of the time at 30mg for 2 yrs. I then lost my job. She added 2mg of Abilify for the last 8 mos. of those 2 yrs on Lexapro. Time passed and my life got better. I don’t believe the Lexapro or Abilify helped me in the least. I CT’d off the Lexapro and Abilify at the same time. After about a month, I went into a hell that is indescribable. I suffered for 5 mos and am amazed I am alive.\\n  I tried reinstating Lexapro using the liquid. It was a disaster. Someone on the forum gave me advice to stay away from the liquid. The person saved my life. The liquid was much too strong. I then got tablets. I  split a 5mg tablet into quarters. I started taking 1.25mg. I stayed on that for a month. Very, very Slight improvement. I then took 2.5mg. Stayed at that for 4-6 weeks. Then 5 mg, 7.5, 10mg, 12.5, and finally 15mg. I stayed at each increase for 4-6 weeks hoping I could stop. 15mg is when the intense dread and fear subsided. Although there had been improvements along the way. At most every increase, I had a couple of days of awful adrenaline surges. It was rough. I was taking 1mg of Klonopin per day at the time. \\n  I am now tapering the Klonopin. I am down to .475mg per day. I haven’t returned to work. But I am alive. I am there for my children and husband. I feel that I am severely traumatized from what happened. \\n  I think many people would benefit from reinstating with a portion of a tablet rather than liquid.  I would love to get off of the Lexapro someday if I can gather the courage and the strength to try. My heart goes out to anyone dealing with this. I was seriously planning to end my life, the suffering was so intense. No where near anything I had ever experienced in my entire life. \\n  Edited April 10, 2018 by ChessieCat\\nadded spacing</td>\n",

       "3  So, I really never suffered from depression. I did suffer from anxiety. I had been taking around 1 mg of Xanax for approx 4 or 5 yrs. Due to life circumstances, I made a huge mistake. I was feeling overwhelmed and went to a psychiatrist for the first time in my life. I went on Lexapro, most of the time at 30mg for 2 yrs. I then lost my job. She added 2mg of Abilify for the last 8 mos. of those 2 yrs on Lexapro. Time passed and my life got better. I don’t believe the Lexapro or Abilify helped me in the least. I CT’d off the Lexapro and Abilify at the same time. After about a month, I went into a hell that is indescribable. I suffered for 5 mos and am amazed I am alive.\\n  I tried reinstating Lexapro using the liquid. It was a disaster. Someone on the forum gave me advice to stay away from the liquid. The person saved my life. The liquid was much too strong. I then got tablets. I  split a 5mg tablet into quarters. I started taking 1.25mg. I stayed on that for a month. Very, very Slight improvement. I then took 2.5mg. Stayed at that for 4-6 weeks. Then 5 mg, 7.5, 10mg, 12.5, and finally 15mg. I stayed at each increase for 4-6 weeks hoping I could stop. 15mg is when the intense dread and fear subsided. Although there had been improvements along the way. At most every increase, I had a couple of days of awful adrenaline surges. It was rough. I was taking 1mg of Klonopin per day at the time. \\n  I am now tapering the Klonopin. I am down to .475mg per day. I haven’t returned to work. But I am alive. I am there for my children and husband. I feel that I am severely traumatized from what happened. \\n  I think many people would benefit from reinstating with a portion of a tablet rather than liquid.  I would love to get off of the Lexapro someday if I can gather the courage and the strength to try. My heart goes out to anyone dealing with this. I was seriously planning to end my life, the suffering was so intense. No where near anything I had ever experienced in my entire life. \\n  Edited April 10, 2018 by ChessieCat\\nadded spacing   \n",

       "      <td>So, I really never suffered from depression. I did suffer from anxiety. I had been taking around 1 mg of Xanax for approx 4 or 5 yrs. Due to life circumstances, I made a huge mistake. I was feeling overwhelmed and went to a psychiatrist for the first time in my life. I went on Lexapro, most of the time at 30mg for 2 yrs. I then lost my job. She added 2mg of Abilify for the last 8 mos. of those 2 yrs on Lexapro. Time passed and my life got better. I don’t believe the Lexapro or Abilify helped me in the least. I CT’d off the Lexapro and Abilify at the same time. After about a month, I went into a hell that is indescribable. I suffered for 5 mos and am amazed I am alive.\\n  I tried reinstating Lexapro using the liquid. It was a disaster. Someone on the forum gave me advice to stay away from the liquid. The person saved my life. The liquid was much too strong. I then got tablets. I  split a 5mg tablet into quarters. I started taking 1.25mg. I stayed on that for a month. Very, very Slight improvement. I then took 2.5mg. Stayed at that for 4-6 weeks. Then 5 mg, 7.5, 10mg, 12.5, and finally 15mg. I stayed at each increase for 4-6 weeks hoping I could stop. 15mg is when the intense dread and fear subsided. Although there had been improvements along the way. At most every increase, I had a couple of days of awful adrenaline surges. It was rough. I was taking 1mg of Klonopin per day at the time. \\n  I am now tapering the Klonopin. I am down to .475mg per day. I haven’t returned to work. But I am alive. I am there for my children and husband. I feel that I am severely traumatized from what happened. \\n  I think many people would benefit from reinstating with a portion of a tablet rather than liquid.  I would love to get off of the Lexapro someday if I can gather the courage and the strength to try. My heart goes out to anyone dealing with this. I was seriously planning to end my life, the suffering was so intense. No where near anything I had ever experienced in my entire life. \\n  Edited April 10, 2018 by ChessieCat\\nadded spacing</td>\n",

       "3  So, I really never suffered from depression. I did suffer from anxiety. I had been taking around 1 mg of Xanax for approx 4 or 5 yrs. Due to life circumstances, I made a huge mistake. I was feeling overwhelmed and went to a psychiatrist for the first time in my life. I went on Lexapro, most of the time at 30mg for 2 yrs. I then lost my job. She added 2mg of Abilify for the last 8 mos. of those 2 yrs on Lexapro. Time passed and my life got better. I don’t believe the Lexapro or Abilify helped me in the least. I CT’d off the Lexapro and Abilify at the same time. After about a month, I went into a hell that is indescribable. I suffered for 5 mos and am amazed I am alive.\\n  I tried reinstating Lexapro using the liquid. It was a disaster. Someone on the forum gave me advice to stay away from the liquid. The person saved my life. The liquid was much too strong. I then got tablets. I  split a 5mg tablet into quarters. I started taking 1.25mg. I stayed on that for a month. Very, very Slight improvement. I then took 2.5mg. Stayed at that for 4-6 weeks. Then 5 mg, 7.5, 10mg, 12.5, and finally 15mg. I stayed at each increase for 4-6 weeks hoping I could stop. 15mg is when the intense dread and fear subsided. Although there had been improvements along the way. At most every increase, I had a couple of days of awful adrenaline surges. It was rough. I was taking 1mg of Klonopin per day at the time. \\n  I am now tapering the Klonopin. I am down to .475mg per day. I haven’t returned to work. But I am alive. I am there for my children and husband. I feel that I am severely traumatized from what happened. \\n  I think many people would benefit from reinstating with a portion of a tablet rather than liquid.  I would love to get off of the Lexapro someday if I can gather the courage and the strength to try. My heart goes out to anyone dealing with this. I was seriously planning to end my life, the suffering was so intense. No where near anything I had ever experienced in my entire life. \\n  Edited April 10, 2018 by ChessieCat\\nadded spacing   \n",

       "      <td>so  i really never suffered from depression  i did suffer from anxiety  i had been taking around  mg of xanax for approx  or  yr  due to life circumstance  i made a huge mistake  i wa feeling overwhelmed and went to a psychiatrist for the first time in my life  i went on lexapro  most of the time at mg for  yr  i then lost my job  she added mg of abilify for the last  mo  of those  yr on lexapro  time passed and my life got better  i don t believe the lexapro or abilify helped me in the least  i ct d off the lexapro and abilify at the same time  after about a month  i went into a hell that is indescribable  i suffered for  mo and am amazed i am alive     i tried reinstating lexapro using the liquid  it wa a disaster  someone on the forum gave me advice to stay away from the liquid  the person saved my life  the liquid wa much too strong  i then got tablet  i  split a mg tablet into quarter  i started taking  mg  i stayed on that for a month  very  very slight improvement  i then took  mg  stayed at that for   week  then  mg     mg     and finally mg  i stayed at each increase for   week hoping i could stop  mg is when the intense dread and fear subsided  although there had been improvement along the way  at most every increase  i had a couple of day of awful adrenaline surge  it wa rough  i wa taking mg of klonopin per day at the time      i am now tapering the klonopin  i am down to  mg per day  i haven t returned to work  but i am alive  i am there for my child and husband  i feel that i am severely traumatized from what happened      i think many people would benefit from reinstating with a portion of a tablet rather than liquid   i would love to get off of the lexapro someday if i can gather the courage and the strength to try  my heart go out to anyone dealing with this  i wa seriously planning to end my life  the suffering wa so intense  no where near anything i had ever experienced in my entire life      edited april    by chessiecat  added spacing</td>\n",

       "3      so  i really never suffered from depression  i did suffer from anxiety  i had been taking around  mg of xanax for approx  or  yr  due to life circumstance  i made a huge mistake  i wa feeling overwhelmed and went to a psychiatrist for the first time in my life  i went on lexapro  most of the time at mg for  yr  i then lost my job  she added mg of abilify for the last  mo  of those  yr on lexapro  time passed and my life got better  i don t believe the lexapro or abilify helped me in the least  i ct d off the lexapro and abilify at the same time  after about a month  i went into a hell that is indescribable  i suffered for  mo and am amazed i am alive     i tried reinstating lexapro using the liquid  it wa a disaster  someone on the forum gave me advice to stay away from the liquid  the person saved my life  the liquid wa much too strong  i then got tablet  i  split a mg tablet into quarter  i started taking  mg  i stayed on that for a month  very  very slight improvement  i then took  mg  stayed at that for   week  then  mg     mg     and finally mg  i stayed at each increase for   week hoping i could stop  mg is when the intense dread and fear subsided  although there had been improvement along the way  at most every increase  i had a couple of day of awful adrenaline surge  it wa rough  i wa taking mg of klonopin per day at the time      i am now tapering the klonopin  i am down to  mg per day  i haven t returned to work  but i am alive  i am there for my child and husband  i feel that i am severely traumatized from what happened      i think many people would benefit from reinstating with a portion of a tablet rather than liquid   i would love to get off of the lexapro someday if i can gather the courage and the strength to try  my heart go out to anyone dealing with this  i wa seriously planning to end my life  the suffering wa so intense  no where near anything i had ever experienced in my entire life      edited april    by chessiecat  added spacing   \n",
